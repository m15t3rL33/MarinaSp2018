<p> <h3> MY WORLD: <h3> <p>  
    
<p> Hi there, my name is Areeba and I am an 8th grader who goes to Marina Middle School. I was born in San Francisco and I have lived here my whole life. I grew up in the city and I love the city life. Growing up, I have travel a few places and I am very adventurous. I like to hang out with my friends and play volleyball and most of my day goes by from doing that. <p>
