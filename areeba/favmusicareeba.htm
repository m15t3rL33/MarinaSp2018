<br> my favorite songs by Lauv is "the other , I like me better, chasing fire, Breathe,and Getting over you" <br>
     
<br> Lauv is a young guy who sings songs and creates songs. I find his songs very heart touching and meaningful. He makes music which is really deep and it also has very nice music to it. When I do homework or some other typeof work, I love listening to his music. It is also soothing to hear his voice. <br>
  
<br> Another reason why I like his songs and why he is my favorite is because it makes me happy. Whenever I am sad or feeling down, it makes me feel better. <br>
