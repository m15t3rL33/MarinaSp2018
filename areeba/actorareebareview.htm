        <br> <h2> John Cena was the voice of Ferdinand who is ox. Ferdinand is about a ox who loses his father in a young age and as a kid he explores and finds a new family. He had a dream to go to a ox fight and be able to win it. He then tries to fufill that dream with a new family that he meets </h2>
<p> <h3> In the movie Ferdinand, it spoke to me by telling me to never give up your hopes and dreams and to never give up. I think that because when ferdinand loses his dad, he thinks that he will never be able to get his dreams fufilled. But he still tried to explore and did not give up as easily. He found a new path to getting his dreams fulfilled.<h3> <p>
<br> <h3> It also taught to never give up. No matter where life takes you, you will find your path to where you want to be. Just like ferdinand, you will find another way and it will get you to your best <h3> <br>
<br> <h3> Actors like John Cena should be in movies like this becuase he really expresses the different emotions of Ferdinand and can teach you a lot <h3><br>
