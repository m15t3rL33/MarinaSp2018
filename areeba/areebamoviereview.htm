    <h1> <b> Review on: Ferdinand  </b> </h1>
  
    <br> <h2>One of the actors was John Cena as the voice of Ferdinand   <br> </h2>
    
 <p><h3>Ferdinand is a story about an ox who lives in a farm with other oxes. When he was a baby, his dad got taken to a slaughter house and was killed. He then runs away to save her dad and on his journey he finds a family that he lives with and loves. It was like his second family. This movie spoke me to because the moral of it is you might loose something important, does not mean you should give up on everything becuase you will find something else on your journey. Ferdinand was sad but he got better throughout the way.<p></h3>
    
<br> <h3>From this movie, I learned to never give up becuase ferdinand had a dream which would not be possible without his dad, but later he actually got to go to the bull fight and he ended up winning too. <br></h3>

<br> <h3><b>Movies like this should be made in hollywood because it has a message in it which is emotional and it is inspirational as well. It could also be easily explained to a young kid because it is in cartoon. This can help many other kids as well.<b> <br> </h3>
