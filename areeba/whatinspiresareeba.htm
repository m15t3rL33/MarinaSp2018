  <h1> Music:<h1>  

<br><h2> Music does a really big impact in my life. It helps me all the time when I am sad or mad. It also gives me a good vibe whenever I have nothing to do or when I am just bored. Most songs have a meaning to it which inspires me the most because it gives you a message. I love listening to music all the time. Without music, I would be a really boring person and I would not be so social. The lyrics of a song can lead to a story and most of the time it does. I can relate with some song lyrics which is the best part because I get even more inspired. </h2><br>
    
<br><h2> All though I have no younger siblings,I think that I do inspire some of my younger siblings. I love writing and playing games with them and I think that they might be interested because of me. Whenever we are together, we listen to music too. I always try my best to inspire them, but sometimes, they might think that I am just bossing them around<h2> <br>

<br> One of my other inspirations is my friends. They inspire me a lot too because they are always there for me. I am the most inspired by them because I do things that they do. For instance, I am a person who does not like hiking, and after my friends asked me to go, I went and I had a lot of fun. We went to Lands End and I have never been there. I expected there to be a lot of forests, But it was a lot of mountains, and it was fun finding trails. <br>
