 <h1 style= "color:white ;"> Graduation is almost here and I have mixed emotions about it. I am excited to graduate and go into summer but at the same I will miss my friends. It will be a very emotional day for everyone, but hey, you are now one step closer to highschool. Also, it is fun that we get to leave school two days earlier than the other grade levels. There are many other fun activities coming our way. </h1>
    
<h1 style= "color:white ;"> The highschool that I got accepted to is George Washington High School. It is located in Richmond district and also it is near the Golden Gate Bridge. Wash has 28 sports teams that I find really interesting. I am planning to join a team in highschool becuase I want to become more athletic. </h1>
    
    
<h1> <p style="color:white ;" > Highschool seems to be so far away but it is around the corner. Over summer, I am going to try to be ready for highschool. I think that transitioning from middle school to high school will be a big change, but you just have to get used to it. For example, one thing that will change is the time because high school starts earlier than my current school and I am going to have to wake up for school even earlier. I will have 4 years of it, so I am pretty sure I'll get used to it.
