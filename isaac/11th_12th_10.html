The hardest thing to do in 10th grade is to keep your grade to an "A" or a "B" or a "C" in order to get into 11th. The easiest thing to do is to drop out or have friends that pulls you down with them but that will lead you to the wrong path in life, it won't get you into 11th grade at all.</font></p>
