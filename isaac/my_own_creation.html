            <p><font size="6">One world problem is the Nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons that are armed at all times have the potential to kill hundreds of millions of people, and billions due to their stupidity to attack the U.S. They say that some unknown risk of human extinction through the potential for a ‘nuclear bomb’ and a social collapse from which we never recover. There has been many times in history that which the US or Russia came close to accidentally using their nuclear weapons against each other and against others.

Nuclear security is already a major topic of interest for every country in the world, making it harder to have a solution for not going to war with nuclear bombs. Most opportunities to influence the risk from nuclear weapons seem to be through work in the military because of the act of war between one another. Some less approaches would be working independently to improve relationships between people in the nuclear powers, or trying to improve of our food supply in the case of a serious collapse. The thing is that there has to be smart leaders in the world unlike right now. For example Donald trump is one of the worst president of all time in my opinion. He was tweeting on twitter about how big of a button he has for pressing for the nuclear launch.

Even though usually the politician sometimes won’t do anything for you if you protested against anything they won’t listen like the gun rights because it would of been solved by now. But if the world does that would be a different thing because everyone is part of it instead of just the politician listening to the people in the U.S. they would have to listen to the entire world.
