            <h1>What inspires me!</h1>
  
    <p><font size="6">There is not that inspires me but I do have some things that does inspire me. My dad is trying to be a computer programer at the age of 56. He says that he is going against kids that are at least my age or older and he hasn't give up. That is what makes me want to do computer programming. While my dad is older than most parents that I know and I want to make him proud of me before he gone and he also says coding is the future job because the robots take mcdonalds, burger king, and most of the fast food restaurant in like 10 years while it will take a long time to get a robot to type as fast as an real person. That is my number one thing that inspire me. When I was young I want to be part of the army or at least know what it feels like to be in the army because my dad was part of the army. My dad said to me "I will kill you before the army kills me." Ever since I was into coding. I have not been inspired by anything else besides my dad and that is the only one that is keeping my life going.
        </font></p>
            
            <p><font size="6">Another thing that keeps me going is music. Without music I would be lazy and tired constantly. There are multiple songs but like one was called "I wish I never found you." It is about how someone hurt someone and I wish I never knew someone and what her name was but for some reason I keep going with this song, I notice by if I did not hear it I would not be in a good mood. There are a lot of songs in the world but there are specific ones that get me going. </font></p>
