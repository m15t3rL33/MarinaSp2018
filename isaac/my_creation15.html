    <p><font size="6">Another creation is about a game named Fortnite. A lot of kids in middle school love Fortnite and they enjoy it. The basic thing of fortnite is a game of survival, you get put on a big piece of land, and you have to find some tools etc ... then there you have to go into a big circle and look for characters, or online players to fight. The thing is that kids are addicted to this because the game is online and it is competitive. The game fortnite does not make your child more violent. The game of fortnite should be for kids that are 13 and up.

In order for kids to play fortnite they have to create an account on a a system. While in the game you can create bases. You also great enemies that hate you after you kill them in the game. The game is really good graphics and other good stuff as like looks about it. That requires high coding skills and the functions are absolutely high about the tools getting eliminated and jumping etc.

The competition is more higher than other games. The reason why kids are more into Fortnite then other games is that it could possibly deal with the animation, creativity. Plus the challengers against the other online players. The skins in the game and the types of tools you can get a higher type of tools level. Which could be more interesting to our generation because maybe they have been studying us for type of games we like and put them all together.
