            <h1>Dilemma</h1>

            <p><font size="6">  If I had the ability to hack into school computer system and change someones grade but I would not change everyones grade but I will do it to the people I am close with. Of course I would do it to myself because my dad would not be bothering me constantly if I was able to bring my grade up. I would not have to be pressure everyday. The reason why is that I do not have worry of not making it to high school. The thing when it comes to someone else that would be a different story.

I would do it for only the people I am close with and the people I care about. For instance my best friends and some other person I would do it for. But if it is for a basketball person either trying to get into the basketball team or the basketball player Guarantee to get into an Ivy League I would not do it because it is their fault that they did not get a good grade to get into that. The thing is if it is for a friend that is trying to raise its grade but it is difficult for him or her. Then I would do it for that person instead of a person that only wants to have a purpose to be in the Ivy League.

The thing is that if I get fought for hacking into the grading thing I could get into a lot of trouble. I am not sure but I could even go to jail and I am not even sure if l will get into jail. The thing is that if I reject the student that is trying to get into the Ivy League. He or she could even report me and could get me into trouble even if I am guarantee not to get into trouble I could get into trouble because of that person. The thing that I would do is hack.

The reason why I would hack is that I want a good grade. I want to be successful for my dad. Another reason could be that I do not want to seem very dumb in front of my friends at school and outside of school. Because also in high school there is a chance that if I am trying to make new friends and they ask for what my grades were in middle school and if I said something bad they will possibly think damn heâ€™s dumb then decide not to be friends.
