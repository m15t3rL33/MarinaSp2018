            <h1>What I want to for a job</h1>
                <button>
                    <a href="https://www.google.org/?safe=active&ssui=on">google </a>
                    </button>       
            <p><font size="6"> The button to the left leads to google website and that job is my first place i work at and the opportunity to try to go for because it is were a lot of programmers go for. It is the top search engine in the world because it is so basic while everything else is complicated. The pay job for this is very well and most people are satisfied with their job pay. The place at google is a very place for a comfortable place to work because they have comfortable seats, food, and they can take breaks whenever they want to.

                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>
                </button>
                <p><font size="6">The reason why facebook would be good is people on the campus won't judge anything about you. Like there is no judging about your race, of what you like and ect. People see facebook as a good place to work because the ceo Mark Zuckerberg he is a respectful person to whoever you are. It's a good place to do code because right now they are needing people to fix the website facebook.

                   <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a>    
                </button>
                   <p><font size="6">Twitter is my third place to choose to work at because I did some research on good places to work at and it showed Twitter at 26th best place to work at. But even though it is 26th place it is not a bad place to work at. The reason why is that their mission is to "Keep the world informed by serving the public conversation," and if there is something bad around the world they would be able to find. Their pay is $2-$5 billion dollars a year which is very well pay in my opinion. They also constantly do updates that means that you can constantly work and get more money then you are suppose to.
