     <h1>A Worldwide / Community Problem</h1>
     <p>A worldwide or community problem I think that we need to solve is the misuse of guns. Guns are weapons used for defense, like what a police officer should be armed with. Recently, the use of guns are getting out of hand, with many school shootings happening in the United States. Even worse, the government is not doing anything to stop the misuse of guns, like releasing a law for gun control. The United States had 28 mass shootings this year, and we are only in April.</p>
     <p>So here's a little history about guns. The earliest forms of gunpowder were made by China in the 9th century. The Song Dynasty used this gunpowder in a battle against their enemy, the Jurchen. A sculpture from a Sichuan cave from the 12th century was the closest interpretation of a gun. Gunpowder made its way to Europe from the Silk Road, where countries would trade with one another.</p>
     <p>In order to buy or own a gun, you have to be of age, which is 18-21 years old, depending on where you live. Nowadays, it's easier than ever to get a gun. According to some research, some states even allow people as young as 15 years old to be in possession of a gun, with parental permission of course. Even though 15 year-olds are not allowed to purchase a gun, knowing that they can be in possession of one is scary enough. Who knows what they can do with such a dangerous weapon?</p>
     <p>Guns are meant for self defense, but if they get into the wrong hands, things can go wrong. One way to prevent this is to buy a gun like a car, which means obtaining a license to use it. If you happen to be an adult with children in the house, make sure that the gun is stored away in a place where the children cannot get a hold of it. Most mass shootings are caused by kids who have poor mental health, and the most important thing to do is to just be nice to everyone. The kids who have the audacity to even think about shooting a school, could have been bullied in the past, so just treat everyone with respect.</p>
