	<p>Hey, I’m Waverly, and I’m here to tell you a little about myself. I live with my mom, dad, and little sister. I attended Gordon J. Lau Elementary School, and I got into Wallenberg High School, but I’m transferring to George Washington High School.</p>
	<p>I’m a very lazy person, so joining extracurricular activities? Never heard of it. The things I enjoy aren’t even considered hobbies. I like to surf the internet, sleep, eat, and take a huge interest in conspiracy theories. I find conspiracies very interesting, especially the Mandela Effect. They can keep me up at night, but they really question the world we live in. I consider myself an extrovert, because I like to socialize and meet new people.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite foods include sushi, pizza, ice cream, and fries. I'm obsessed with boba; it's just one of my favorite drinks. My favorite apps include Instagram and Snapchat, which are my favorite social media platforms. My favorite place to eat includes "The Melt".</p>
