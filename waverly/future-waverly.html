    <p>I feel like everyone has their life figured out, what college they want to attend, and what career they want to pursue. Truth is, I still have no idea what I want to do in my future. I want a job that I can enjoy, and I would hate to be those people that are always complaining about their job because they hate it so much. A job following this statement would be difficult to find, considering I don't have much hobbies.</p>
    <p>Even though I'm not quite sure what I want to do in the future, I would attend college after graduating high school. I'm not sure what high school I want to go to either, but I heard that <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> is a good school. Before I start working, I would like to get at least a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree">Bachelor's degree</a>, so that it would look better in my resume. I would also get a couple jobs in high school, to get experience for my future career. The more experience I get, the better it would look on my resume. I have an older sister, and she says that it is always good to have experience of any kind before getting a real job. A couple jobs I could get some experience from would be working at fast food restaurants and other places related to it, such as working as a barista in <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> or a cashier in <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a>.</p>

    <p>A job or career I might consider would be a social media influencer (which probably wouldn't happen). I've always had this part of me that wanted to be famous, but the other side tells me that being famous will change you a lot. Being famous can give the attention that I don't want, and my privacy might not be respected. I would also like to work with music of some sort, like being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer">music producer</a>. I can't play an instrument well or have any singing talent, but I can definitely help out with producing songs. I love music, and it would be great to be in the studio making songs..
