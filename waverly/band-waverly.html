    <p>SZA's full name is Solana Imani Rowe. She released her album 'CTRL', which launched on June 9, 2017. 'CTRL' also hit Number 3 on the Billboard Top 200. Some songs in her album include 'Love Galore', 'The Weekend', and 'Broken Clocks'. She was also feautured on a couple songs, including 'What Lovers Do' by Maroon 5, 'All the Stars' with Kendrick Lamar, and 'I Do' with Cardi B.</p>
     <p> Some of my favorites from her would have to be 'Love Galore' and 'The Weekend', along with her new song with Cardi B, 'I Do'. After listening to these songs, I started listening to more R&B music. Some R&B artists I started listening to more were Drake and The Weeknd. Most of their songs belong into the Hip-Hop and Rap category, but I listen to their R&B songs as well. I have no idea why it is my favorite genre of music, but I guess it's just because I like how the background tune is very calming. I've always liked Hip-Hop and Rap, and the R&B music I listen to are very similar. </p>
     <p>SZA was nominated for 5 Grammy awards, btu unfortunately won none of them. She had a nomination for Best New Artist. Her song 'The Weekend' had a nomination for Best R&B Performance. 'Supermodel' had a nominee for Best R&B Song. Her debut album 'CTRL' had a nominee for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Her song 'Love Galore' with Travis Scott had a nominee for Best Rap/Sung Performance.
