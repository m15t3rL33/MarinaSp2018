     <h1>Some Unpopular Opinions</h1>
     <p>This first session of unpopular opinions will be food related. I DESPISE bitter melon, which is an Asian vegetable my mother likes to put into soup. She says that it's good for the body, but it's nasty, I tell you. I also prefer Coca-Cola over Pepsi, because I don’t like that aftertaste of Pepsi. A weird food combination I like is fries and ice cream. It seems weird at first, but it actually tastes good once you try it. </p>
     <p>There has been a big debate on whether pineapple belongs on pizza, and in my opinion, I don't care, because I don't like pineapples anyways. I also eat chocolate bars by ripping off the pieces one by one, not bite it as a whole. If you eat a chocolate bar by just biting off the bar, we can not be friends. I also hate artificial fruit flavors, like watermelon and grape in candy. I love fruits in their natural form, and the flavor of it in the candy ruins the real flavor of the fruit. </p>
     <p>I pronounce milk as "milk", and not "melk". If you pronounce milk as "melk", please don’t speak to me. I happen to pronounce either as “eye-ther” instead of "e-ther", but I pronounce neither as "nee-ther", instead of “nye-ther”. I find that kind of weird, because if I pronounce either as "eye-ther", then I should pronounce neither as “nye-ther”. I also pronounce caramel as "care-a-mell", rather than "car-mell". There’s an "a" in caramel, so why not just pronounce that with the word?</p>
     <p>I prefer tv shows over movies, because I like how I can binge watch a show, but you can't binge watch movies. A show I like is "Riverdale", but Season 1 was way better than Season 2. I feel like Season 2 opened up so many storylines that were never completed. Season 1 was a lot more put together, because everything fell into place. My last unpopular opinion will be about the second season of "13 Reasons Why". Like what are they going to do, make Hannah alive? I would like to know about happens to the other characters, but a second season seems sort of pointless. </p>
