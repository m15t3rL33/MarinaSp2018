    <h1><center>Countdown to Graduation</center></h1>
    <txt>
    <p>As of April 16, 2018, the Class of 2018 is graduating in 49 days. I'm a very informal person, so I don't like wearing dresses or heels, or any clothing that screams "formal" at all. I'm the person you see that's always in t-shirts and sweats all day. With no gowns for this year's graduation ceremony, that means I have to wear a dress this year. I wish we had gowns, though, it would be great to turn my tazzle from my cap to the other side to symbolize graduating.</p> 
    <p>In order to graduate, there are a certain amount of requirements to graduate. Me, being the procrastinator I am, I still haven't finished my community service, which has to be turned in by the end or April. Some events for eighth graders include the trip to Great America and the Dinner Dance. If I manage to get my community service done on time, then I can attend the two events. I'm glad that we have these events for eighth grade, since we don't get as much field trips like we used to in elementary school.</p>
    <p>I got into Wallenberg High School, but I'm transferring to George Washington High School. No matter the school I get into, I just want to get through the school year with good grades and no pointless drama. From what my older sister told me, high school is going to be easy, as long as I get my homework done and study for tests on time. I hope that I have a good time in high school, and that I can meet new friends. High school is my last years of being a child, and I'm going to make the most of it.</p>
