	<h1>The Mandela Effect</h1>
	<p>The Mandela Effect is the phenomena of false memory, which is when something was believed that it happened, but didn't. This was named the Mandela Effect after what happened with Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was a South American human rights activist. It was believed that he died in prison in the 1980s, until there were news saying that he was released from prison. He then "passed away" in 2013. This was not the only misremembering that has happened though, because people have started to misremember things as well.</p>
	<p>Some other examples include a line by the Evil Queen in the film "Snow White". She was believed to say "Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" If you rewatch the footage, she actually says "Magic Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" Most people remember the Berenstein Bears, but the show was actually the Berenstain Bears, with an "a". There has been proof that this was not just some misremembering, because Berenstein Bears has existed before.</p>
	<p>Why can this be happening? Some people believe that there could've been people who went back in time to change history, creating alternate realities. Others have even gone as far as to say that ending of the world in 2012 never occurred because it was the end of our current universe, where we shifted to a new one. False memory experts say that our brain knows of two memories that were combined together. This confuses our mind, and makes us believe that something that wasn't real happened.</p>
	<p>Some people believe that this is fake, but I believe that it could possibly be real. It would be cool to know that we live in an alternate universe. I love conspiracies theories, so I would love to find out more. This is sort of scary though, with all the evidence that I've seen. There are so many things that we don't know about, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was real.</p>
