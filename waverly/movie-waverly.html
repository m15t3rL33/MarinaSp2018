    <p>'Mean Girls' is a comedy classic, about a girl named Caty Heron <i>(Linsey Lohan)</i> who enters her first year of high school after being in Africa with her parents for a research trip. She meets some friends named Damian Leigh <i>(Daniel Franceze)</i> and Janice Ian <i>(Lizzy Caplan)</i>. The two hates the 'Plastics', or the popular group of girls, named Regina George <i>(Rachel McAdams)</i>, Gretchin Wieners <i>(Lacey Chabert)</i>, and Karen Smith <i>(Amanda Seyfried)</i>. They take an interest in Caty, and she starts slowly becoming friends with the 'Plastics'. Janice and Damian take advantage of their friendship to find the 'Burn Book', filled with secrets and rumors about everyone in their school. Regina spreads the rumors of the Burn Book, but Caty took the blame. She then returned to her old self of being an outcast, and made amends with the 'Plastics'.</p>
    <p>I love this movie because of the humor, I just find every quote so iconic, especially 'That's so fetch'. I've watched this movie so many times, and each time, I laugh as hard as when I first did. It's such a classic that I can never get bored watching. I've watched this movie so many times before, I think I knwo the whole scipt. This movie is just great to watch when you are feeling down; this will give you a great laugh.</p>
    <p>After watching this movie, it really made me think about my friends, and how lucky I was to have these people in my life that I could trust. I'm just glad that my friends aren't like the 'Plastics', that pretend to be your friend but talk about you behind your back. I've dealt with fake friends; we've all dealt with fake friends. But the biggest lesson I realized from this movie was how the people that you are around can influence you so much, even if you don't realize it.</p>
    <p>As much as I loved 'Mean Girls', 'Mean Girls 2' could not compare. Who's idea was it to switch up the cast members? That's just as bad as thinking that having 'High School Musical 4' without the original cast would turn out well, like no one can play Sharpay better than Ashley Tisdale.</p>
