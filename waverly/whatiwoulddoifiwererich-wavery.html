     <h1>What I Would Do If I were Famous and Rich</h1>
     <p>There was always a part of me that wants to be famous. How cool would it be to have people that you don’t even know support you? But with fame comes many other difficulties, like paparazzi everywhere and people being friends with you only for the fame. Because of those things, I want to be famous without revealing my real identity; basically living a Hannah Montana lifestyle.</p>
     <p>The first thing I would do with my fame is to donate my money to the people that need it. With fame comes money, so why not use it for things that matter? I want to start a campaign to help others in need, such as the homelessness, people who are struggling financially, and the people who struggle to get things necessary to life in general. With my big platform, I could get more people to support my campaign.</p>
     <p>The next thing I would do with my fame and money is to help my family. As much as I want to support my friends, family is always the most important. I would buy them a mansion, with people to help do chores for them. My mom already works hard enough, so she deserves a break from all the hard work she does. Pleasing my family was something that was at the top of my goals, and is something I'm always striving to achieve. </p>
     <p>The next thing I would do with my fame is try things that I will probably never do in my life. I would go skydiving, even though I'm afraid of heights. I'd also travel the world, because I want to explore more than just where I live. A place I want to go to is Paris, France; the scenery and food there looks amazing. When I’m famous, not letting the fame and money get to me is so important, and I would never want to lose myself in that process. </p>
