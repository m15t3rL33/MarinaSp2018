    <h1><center>What Inspires Me/ How I Become Inspired</center></h1>
    <txt>
    <p>A very random fact, but I just have this sudden urge of inspiration to pull my life together when I'm  trying to sleep. I always want to become a better person, because sometimes, we don't realize that what we say could impact so much around us. Of course, I end up falling asleep and forget that I should put some effort into becoming a better person. I end up eating chips, going on my phone way too much, sit in my house doing nothing, and just doing things that aren't good for me. As you can tell, I'm a very unproductive person.
    <p>Me finding the motivation to do anything starts with one thing, my phone. As everyone knows, I am always on social media. I'm scrolling through my feed, and I probably see this Twitter thread about how to be more motivated to study, or how to be a healthier person. Even the FBI agent on my phone knows that I should be more productive, so they give me these threads of motivation. Of course, I end up reading the thread, and then I'm thinking "hm, maybe I should clean my room", or "maybe I should start studying for that test that's coming up". So long story short, social media gives me that boost of motivation to be a better version of me.
    <p>I practice self care very often, I do face masks, take baths, and just treat myself. School can be stressful, and self care is very de-stressing, and definitely gets things that I don't want to do, done. Some things I do to practice self care is cleaning my room, getting some exercise, making something healthy to eat, and just doing anything that doesn't require my phone in general. I put my mental health above everything, and I feel like that is something that should be taken into consideration.
