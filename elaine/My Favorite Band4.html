    <h style="font-size:400%;"><b><center>BTS</center></b></h>
<br style="font-size:200%;"><i> Genre of band:K-pop/Rock Music</i></br>
    <br>Some of my favorite songs from BTS are MIC drop, DNA, Go Go, Blood Sweat And Tears, and of course, Danger.</br>
    
        <h4>They are my favorite band because their first season music was soo good especially 'fire'. Their songs have very catchy English lyrics for you to shout if you don't speak English. Even the other K-pop groups can be caught showing off some BTS moves. Ther fanbase, called ARMY, is worldwide and growing stronger by the day. Last but not least, they love love their fans and treat them all like baby angels. They even have their own customised sweater which I really really want to have. They know how to give the people and their fans exactly what they want, even if it is just a piece of confetti floating around in the air on the stage. Every single performance tey give is amazing but they remain so, so humble. They take good care of each other and work incredibly hard to reach the goal they want. BTS, this boyband are the best at award shows because they are not afraid of looking like weirdos if it will make their fans laugh. And at the end of the day, they truly love each other and it's heartwarming. Come on, just look at them. </h4>
