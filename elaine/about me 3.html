<h1>Heyy!! Friend!!</h1>
<p>My name is worth a thousand conversations and it is <i><ins>Elaine Sun</ins></i>. Not a lot of my friend knows this... I am actually born in China, Guangzhou or Canton. As you can see below, that is a picture of the Canton Tower. An interesting fact that I just found out is that this is the second tallest tower in the world, making its height 1,982 feet tall. In China, I only learned half way through third grade and I came to America. The date I remembered when I arrived in San Francisco was September 5, 2013 which is roughly about five years ago. I started my first year of school in California as a fourth grader. Back then, I know nothing about English, but my English name and that is it. However, the school year wasn't as tough as I though it would be becuase all the teachers, staffs, and students speak chinese. I was happy that I knew how to start and talk to people in basic English conversation by the end of the school year. Then now, I have moved on to fifth grade in Gordon J. Lau Elementry school.</p>
