    My eighth grade year is about to end and there is less than two months left. I have gone through a lot this school year. A bunch of assignments due that I thought I am going to fail on but eventually overcome. Some eighth grade requirements are...You have to write a letter to the principal about your experiences in school and what you learn. Another requirement is that you can not get more than three unexcused tardy and absent. Also, if get more than three F, you can't pass eighth grade as well. I know I am going to miss middle school so much. I am going to remember all my friends, teachers, hallways I walked through, and the classrooms I sat in.

    No offense, but I really hated Galileo High School before and I don't know why. I just really don't want to go there after my middle school years. My mom suggested me to go to Wallenberg High School. I agreed because I knew that I always wanted to go into a high school where it is small enough for everyone to know me. The thing is that not much people that I know in Marina is going to Wallenberg, so it is going to be very awarkward on the first day of school. After three days of thinking, I decided to transfer into Galileo High School. The problem is that if I don't get accepted by Galileo because they have enough students already, then I have to go to Wallenberg because my mom put that for my first chioce without telling me.

    I have a friend that have a brother in Galileo High School. Her brother told me some information about Galileo. One of them was about a summer reading list. Tis is what he told me...All students must read their grade level text prior to the beginning of the new academic school year. Students will be assessed within the first two weeks on their reading, and scores will be included as part of the frist term grades. Well, all I know is that we don't usually have homework assignments over the summer. I bet high school years are going to be way different than middle school years. I think I am going to be very nervous and exciting on the first day of school because there are a lot of new people that I can be friends with and as well as teachers. I still can not imagine what that day is going to be like.
