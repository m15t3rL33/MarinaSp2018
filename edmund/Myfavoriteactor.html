            <br><h1>Actor Review!</h1>
            <br><h1>-Tye Sheridan spoke to me because he started from a small show into being the cyclops for the x-men.</h1>
            <br><h1>-I learned that even though you are not very famous, you can work your way to being famous by working very hard and never giving up.</h1>
            <br><h1>-I think Tye Sheridan should star in more movies because he is a very good actor and also very inspiring. Tye also has a good past and it is inspiring to many people.</h1>
