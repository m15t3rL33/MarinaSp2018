       <p1>Some songs that I really like from Sam Smith are "Stay With Me", "Too Good At Goodbyes", "I'm Not The Only One", "Latch", and "Lay Me Down". All of the songs here have been on the Top 10 records before.</p1>

       <p2>This band is my most favorite band because the songs really inspire me and I feel like the songs are very true to me. Also, my friends enjoy the music as well. This music is usually what I listen to in my free time. I also really like the music because I feel like the songs describe how I feel and how I am. It really expresses my thoughts without me having to say them out myself.</p2>
