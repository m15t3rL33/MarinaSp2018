            <br><h1>If I could have any superpower
    If I could have any superpower, I would have the power to change time because you can do almost anything you want. Time is very important because you can do whatever you want and whenever you want. You can go back in time to fix any mistake and never get any test wrong. You can take a break when you are in a rough situation for however long you want too. You can also go in the future to see if any accidents happened and go back to prevent that from happening. 
    I would also want the power of changing time because my favorite character from superhero movies is Doctor Strange. He can go forward in time to see outcomes and he can go back in time to stop something from happening. If I could have the same powers, I would never get anything wrong on any test because once I get the results, I can go back and change my answers. Also, I would pay for food, then eat it and go back in time so I would both be full and still have my money. 
    Changing time is like the ultimate super power because you can do anything at all. You can watch a movie before it even comes out and you can play a game before it comes out. You could have infinite tries at a game and never lose. Doctor Strange is so cool because he can transport any matter from one place to another instantly. I watched Infinity Wars and it was so awesome with Doctor Strange.
    I could go back in time to enjoy a roller coaster over and over. I could also go back in time to enjoy my favorite school moments. Some things that I would do with the powers of changing time would stop time during a do now so I could have unlimited amount of time to do it. I would also stop time during a timed event so that I could take however long I need to do it. That is why I want the powers of changing time.</h1>
