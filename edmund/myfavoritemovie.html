            <br><p3>-The movie "Ready Player One" spoke to me because I really enjoy playing games which this movie is all about. Also, it lets players be whatever they want to be, do whatever they want to do, and anything they ever wanted to do.</p3>
            <br><p4>-Something that I learned from the movie was that always look for secrets and never assume by just looking at something/someone. No matter what it may be, it will contain a suprise. Also, the movie had a lot of parts where the player must think outside the box to achieve something.</p4>
            <p5>This movie should be made in Hollywood because many people who are gamers that play games would enjoy this movie.</p5>
