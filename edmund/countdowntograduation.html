            <h1>Hey, I'm Edmund, and I am close to the end 8th Grade, and have already received my high school. The high school that I am going to attend in 2019 is George Washington High School, and I am excited to go there. I have many other friends who are older than me that attend Washington.</h1>
            <br><h1>I am looking forward to high school because it gives me a sense of responsibility and enourages me to work harder in school and help other people who needs more help in the future.</h1>
            <br><h1>I would try my best in high school because it gives me new challenges that I have to overcome and it gives me a new fresh start where I get to meet new freinds.</h1>
            <br><h1>Here are a few responsibilities I must follow in order to succeed in high school.</h1>
