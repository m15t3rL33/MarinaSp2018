            <h1><i>Something That Inspires Me</i></h1>
            <h1>-Something that inspires me to keep working are all the hard working streamers that I watch. They stream every single day because they take time out of their life just to entertain their viewers, which I think is very inspiring to me. One of my favorite streamers are "Ninja", "Myth", and other streamers who stream video games.</h1>
