    <p> Forrest Gump is a movie from the 90s staring <i> Tom Hanks.</i> This movie is about Forrest Gump and his life. From getting shot to running across the country from three and a half years to being a college football star, this man has seemed to have done it all.The one thing he keeps on coming back to is his first friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny Curran. In this movie, you see how he changes over his lifetime and how he changes others lives. </p>
    
    <h3 style="background-color:Aqua;"> Why This Movie Speaks To Me </h3>
    
    <p> This movie is one of the greats. It is about how he pushes through every bad or good thing that happens to him still smiling. Forrest doesn't break down and cry when he learns that his friend is now confined to a wheelchair, he simply gets on a shrimp boat with him and they become shrimp farmers for a while. </p>
