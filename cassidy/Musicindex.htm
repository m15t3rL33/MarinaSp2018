<h1>Twenty One Pilots</h1>
       
<p>I have so many different types of bands that I like,but if you tell me to choose one,I would probably have to choose <b> Twenty One Pilots </b>. Twenty One Pilots falls into many different genres. These genres are <i>alternative hip hop,indie pop,electropop,indie pop,pop rock,rap rock,and alternative rock.</i> Twenty One Pilots is my favorite because their music speaks about real things in life and about growing up while also being very catchy and relatable. You probably hear some of their songs on the radio because they do tend to get very popular.The two band members are Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun and they have been best friends since what seems like forever (their words,not mine). Our fan base is called "the skeleton clique" or just "the clique" for short because of the skeleton hoodies they used to wear in concerts</p>
    
    <p2> They have so many songs that I love, but if i would have to choose just three I would have to choose <i> Goner, Holding on to You, and Polorize. </i> I would have to choose these songs because I find them very relatable in the world I am living in. These songs help me cope when things get hard which is why I love them so much. I hope that you look up these songs and possibly enjoy them as much as I do. </p2>
