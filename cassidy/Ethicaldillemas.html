<h1 style=”color:blanched almond;”>Ethical Dilemma</h1>

<p> 
<I>
You have the ability to hack into your school’s computer system. This means that you can change people's grades. Would you change your own? Why or why not? What if you could change the grade of a basketball player who has a scholarship to play for a big university?

</p>

<p1>What would you do if you had this chance? Would you take it and unleash full hell on the school(Okay that's a little bit of a dramatization, but I'm dramatic so it works)? Would you leave it be and just leave the school at peace? Or would you possibly teach somebody else how to hack the system so then THEY would be the ones who mess with the school and you just stand back and watch? Who does that make you then?</p1>

<p2>If I had this opportunity, I would take the second choice.
