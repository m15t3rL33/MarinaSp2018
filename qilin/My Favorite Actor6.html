    A bit of information of this character in the movie. This character that Hugh Jackman acts is a weary Logan cares for an ailing professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by the dark forces.

    What I love about Wolverine is that he is "humble". In other words, himself in the movie does not really want to be a superhero. Unlike the other people(heros) who are always getting dressed up and jumping around and shining their logo in the clouds. He does not want the celebrity or the credit or the adoration. Again, he is being humble and trying to live like a normal person like everybody else.

    Hugh Jackman's performances is so unremarkable and he always maintained being eye-popping and entertaining that an character requires. He just always make the movies so intensive and making it looked like real life. For example in one scene in Logan, he passed away, making it look so real and heart touching. In the movie, he was a man who always have a serious face on, but on the inside, he is warm-hearted. It taught me to always be kind andnever judge anyone by its cover.
