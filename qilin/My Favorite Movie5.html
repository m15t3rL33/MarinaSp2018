        This movie really spoke to me because it really touched my heart when wolverine died. It tells me that you should really spend more time and care more about people that are close to you. It does not mean your parents hate you when they yell at you. They are just teaching you lessons about life. This movie also inspires me to keep moving in life, in other words, never give up. There is always a future for you, you just have to try hard, harder, and hardest.

        I learned that you have to spend more time with your family. They might die any second so take good care of them and do not be so rude to them. Another lesson I learned from this movie is that not to judge anyone by its cover. It does not mean you can bully anyone due to their background. Everyone have some dark history back in the day when we were kids. This movie also teahes me to never hide and to stand and overcome your fear. You will be proud of your self with the results. You just got to keep trying.

         This movie is great and should be made in the Hollywood because there are a lot of inspirations in the movie. If you're an adult that likes movies that have intensive fighting scenes, this is the movie for you. But it does have a few bloody scenes. Another reason that this is a great movie is because it has a lot of climax. The setting keeps changing which makes the movie more interesting.
