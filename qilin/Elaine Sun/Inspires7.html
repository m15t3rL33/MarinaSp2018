    Inspiration is everywhere. From the words of your favorite writer to the blooms and leaves on yor morning walk. You just need to open your eyes, and breathe it in. Sometimes it helps to talk to others who are creative to get ideas about what gets their creativity line flowing. You just need to investigate the world even if it is just the littlest thing. By doing what you love, you inpire the heart of others.

    My parents are always my role model because they raised me up and teach me how to walk each step in life. Never matter what happens, my and as well as your parents will be there for you at anytime. In school, everyone around me inpires me. They tried so hard to reach there goal even if they failed multiple times. They taught me to never give up and to try my hardest.I remembered watching a chinese action drama and it inpired me to want to go travel around the world when I grow up. It also inpires me to be more brave and have courage to stand in front of the world.

    I have a three and a half years-old sister. When she grow up, I want her to be like me, in other words, I want to inspire her by showing her that I am goin to go to the best college in the USA. I want her to be proud of me and learn from me. I will also show her all the inventions that I have created in school and tell her to try her hardest to reach her goals. I will tell her that it is always okay to try again even if you fails and don't be afraid to do so because everyone will go through this in life. Never matter what, try your hardest and never give up!
