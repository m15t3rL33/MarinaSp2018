<h1>My Future Career</h1>
	<p>
    When I was little, I have always liked adventures. It is because they are always fun and intense. For example, I went camping in <a href="http://allianceredwoods.com/">Alliance Redwood</a>. It was really fun. When I grow up, I want to be a traveler and travel around the world and meet new people. I told my mom about that and she suggested me to learn more languages like Spanish, and French. I was like great idea. She also told me that there are a lot of benefits from learning more than one language. For example, a lot of jobs will want to hire me.
