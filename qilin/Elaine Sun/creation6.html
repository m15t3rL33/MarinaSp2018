<h1><ins>My Pet Peeves</ins></h1>
<p>There are a lot of things that annoy me. Even the littlest thing like a fly flying and buzzing around my head bothers me too. Some people are very tranquil and they never get distracted by anything. I can not be that calm if something is annoying me. I will literally scream and throw everything off the floor. You might think I am someone who is really quite but I am actually not.</p>
<p>There are problems when texting online tht really bothers me. For example, I hated when someone just read  my text and never reply me or just reply with a really short message. And that made me feel really lonely. Some pet peeves I have is when I am doing my homework at the library. There are always those crowd of boys right next to my table playing video games and eating snacks. The crunching sounds really annoy me because I can not focus on my homework if its loud.</p>
<p>I don't know why, I think people who always rock their chair have some problem. If they trip, it will make a loud sound and it will scare me. I also hated when kids cry because of nothing. Like why can't they just eat their food and shut their mouth up.</p>
