    <h1 style="color:white;">My favorite artist is Drake </h1>
    <br> <i> genre of band: hip hop </i> </br> 
    <br> Some of my favorite songs from Drake are Passionfruit, Started from the bottom, Fake love, Trust issues, and Best i ever had.
 <h3> Drake is my favoeite artist. He's been my favorite artist for a very long time now. The song that made me start listening to him more was hot line bling, but now that I think about it, that song is corny. I use to like that song but now I don't. His recent song God's Plan actually went viral because of the music video.</h3>
    <h3> These are my favorite songs, because I can jam to it everytime I listen to them. Also, because there calming to listen to, but there perky at the same time. I never get tired of listening to the same songs. Drake is a great rapper to me and he's been my favorite artist ever since.I even have my own playlist for his songs. I listen to them at least twice a day. </h3>
