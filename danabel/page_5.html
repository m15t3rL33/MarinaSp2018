     <h1> What Inspires me </h1><br>
  <h3> As I told you guys on my introduction page, I want to be a doctor and that it's my dream job. My god mother, who is a doctor inspires me. She told me that it's not easy to become a doctor and the process of becoming one, but if I persevere and push through then my dream will come true. Ever since I was 5, I started playing with my "doctor toys" and my little cousin was my patient. The main reason I want to become a doctor is to help those people in need. When I become a doctor, I want to be one of the best one's. I'm going to admit, I'm a little bit worried because I want to be able to save all my patients and I'm scared to feel guilty if im not succesful with that. </h3>
    <h3> Another thing that inspires me is my mom. She is my role model and best friend. She works really hard for me and I appreciate all that she's done. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. We're not rich, but she still tries her best to get me the things I want and makes it happen. My mom inspires me, because when I grow up to be a mom and have my own children, I want to be just like her. To repay her for all the things she's done for me, I do good at school. I try and work really hard to get all A's and have a 4.0 in my report card because the least I can do is make her happy and proud.</h3>
 <h3> Like I said, if becoming a doctor doesn't work out for me, I want to become a lawyer. I know that becoming a lawyer is hard, especially because of time commitment. I want to help individuals with their legal probelms and make the world a better place. I'm going to have a lot of obstacles I have to overcome since I have to go to law school for a couple of years, but as long as I put my mind to it, I know that I can do it. Things will be easier because my mom will be there to support me in my future jobs. The things I watch in the news inspire me to become a lawyer. </h3>
