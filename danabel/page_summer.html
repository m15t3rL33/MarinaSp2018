    <h1 style="color:violet;"> Plans In The Summer</h1>  
    <h3 style="color:violet;"> It's almost summer and I can't wait till school is over! Summer vacation is a time to kick back, relax, and if your lucky, go on a trip. I am kind of sad, because I won't get to see my friends as often anymore, especially now that none of my close friends are going to the same school as me. I have so many plans for this summer and one of them is going to the Bahamas or Hawaii.</h3>
    <h3 style="color:violet;"> To start off, I don't have to wake up at 6:30 in the morning everyday. During the school year, it was a cycle and I can't get out of it. When summer comes, I wont have to feel tired till 10 a.m. Except my summer job will mess up my sleeping plans. 9 o'clock every morning doesn't sound fun, but I don't want to stay home all day everyday. I will finally what a real "job" feels like. That's another thing, I also have basketball practice 2 times a week. This will be good and prepare for high school when I try out for Lowell's basketball team. </h3>
     <h3 style="color:violet;"> Another thing is no homework! I can imagine it already, not having to worry about it being due the next day. I also don't have to worry about grades going down, and of course my GPA. I don't even want to think about highschool while summer is going on. Of course, I have other things to occupy myself, but i'd rather "work" and have basketball practice.</h3>
     <h3 style="color:violet;"> Lastly, the sun. It would be so nice walking around wearing slippers, with shorts and a tank top. It's honestly not fun to be wearing a gear most of the year. I'd prefer to have slippers on. I can go to the beach and walk around. Thinking about this almost drives me crazy, especially I only have a few weeks till school's out. Things like having sleepovers with my friedns and not having to do any homeowrk. Overall, summer goes by fast and its still coming so I want to make the best of it. </h3>
