     <h1>My Favorite Character from Swindle</h1><br>
     <br> <i> Savannah Westcott played by Jennette McCurdy </i>
  <h4> This character spoke to me in many ways. The main reason however, is because she's one of my favorite actress since she's really funny. Jennette never fails to make me laugh. I first seen her in the tv show iCarly and I use to watch it every time when I was little. Jennette was the only one who made me laugh during the movie. My favorite part was when she pretended to be the daughter of Paul Swindell, because she dressed funny in that part. </h4>
    <h4> In this movie, I learned to never give up on getting what you want. Griffin didn't give up on getting the baseball card. He did a lot of things just to get it. Griffin put his mind to it to make sure it was going to happen. I also learned the true meaning of friendship. Griffin didn't have to help Ben take the baseball card from Paul Swindell, but he chose to. Ben could of lost his house, but with the help of his friends, it didn't happen. </h4>
    <h4> Swindle deserves to get more recognition because it's very different from other movies. I think that it should get an award for being the funniest movie. It will surely make you laugh. Unlike most movies, Swindle isn't boring and wouldn't put you to sleep. This movie has most of the best actors from both Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. The actors are good together and make a good team since they're all funny in there own special way.
