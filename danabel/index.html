  <h3> Howdy, my name is Danabel Fernando and I'm 14 years old. I actually just turned 14 on February 20, 2004. I'm Filipino so I speak tagalog. I'm pretty tall, my height is 5'3 point something. I was born in the Philippines, but I came to America when I was 6 years old in 2011. I really want to visit the Philippines because I miss my family and relatives, especially my grandma. I haven't visisted since 2015 and I hope to go this summer. My favorite food is Fried Chicken and Pasta Carbonara. I never get tired of these two kinds of food and I can eat everyday if I have to for the rest of my life. Everyone that know's me should know my favorite color is purple even if I don't wear it as much, that's why I made it my background color.</h3>
  <h3> Some of my favorite hobbies are playing basketball and going shopping. I played 2 years of basketball at my school,and I continue playing in high school. I was actually the team captain of the basketball team this year. I play small forward as my position. My number last year was 35, but I changed it to 23 this year. Unfortunately, my team did not take the championship trophy, but it's ok because we all had a great season playing together. As for shopping, I also love to do that especially on the weekends. I go shopping with my mom, my friends, even my self. Buying jacket's is my favorite thing. </h3>
                                                  <h3> When I grow up. I either want to be a doctor or lawyer. Well, technically being a doctor is my dream job and lawyer is basically my second choice. Ever since I was a kid, I thought of becoming a doctor because I want to help people get better, especially children. It's very weird though, I'm still scared of blood and I panick when I see blood. Hopefully, as I grow up, that will go away. </h3>
