  <h3> My 8th grade year is about to end, I have 2 months left till the day of graduation, which is June 4th. I've learned a lot of things in Marina during my 3 years and I've learned a lot from my mistakes. The first day I walked in this school, I was very scared, because I knew that it would be very different from elementary. In elementary, we stay in one class the whole day and only have one teacher for the rest of the year , but middle school we move from one class to another at least every hour and have different teachers. Getting F's was another thing I was scared of happening.</h3>
 <h3> I was wrong though, 6th grade wasn't as bad. It actually went well and I mostly got 4.0's. I only got a 3.83 once during 6th grade. I liked my teachers and they weren't really strict. It wasn't what I expected. I was not stressed at all. I didn't have a hard time passing my classmates and I was never late to class. I probably only had one tardy for the whole year. My favorite period was 6 period because it was math and math's my favorite subject. My 6th period teacher was my favorite teacher because she was easy on us. Out of all my years here in marina, 6th grade was my favorite.</h3> 
     <h3> I would say 7th grade was the most challenging year for me. I had a strict teacher and I had him for 2 peiods, english and social studies. 7th grade was the first time I got a C. I was really upset because that teacher expected a lot from me. I had a really hard time in his class. I'd stay up all night to study so I can do good on my tests and quizzes. As months passed by, I got use to my teacher and my grade started going back up. I was really happy and wasn't as stressed as I used to be. Other than that, 7th grade was fine. I only had one problem because of one teacher.</h3>
      <h3> I'm honestly scared for Lowell because everyone is saying that it's very stressful. My mom,  said not to listen to them and not worry though. The maun reason I'm excited to go to highschool is because of back to school shopping. I can't wait till the summer. I want to make new friends there, especially because most of my friends are going to a different school. The main reason I'm excited is because of the basketball team. Lowell is an undefeated school for basketball, well the girls because I don't know about the boys. I hope I make varsity, but it's fine if I only make it to Junior Varisty. </h3>
