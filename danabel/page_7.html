       <h1>9th and 10th Grade</h1>
    <h3 style="color:white;"> When I'm in 9th grade, I don't really expect to get a 4.0 because I heard it's a hard school, but I will try to. One thing I will always advice myself when I get to highschool is to not stress myself out and just stay positive. I know that Lowell be challenging and obviously be harder than 8th grade, that's why I'm preparing myself for it. I expect to be in junior varsity for the basketball team because I have a low chance on making it to varisty, especially because it's mainly for Juniors and Sophomores only. I would need to limit my time on wtaching tv and using my phone. Usually I use my phone for 4 hours at night, but I would need to bring it down to 1 hour.</h3>
    <h3 style="color:white;"> The only thing I don't like about Lowell is that it starts very early in the morning at 7:30, whcih means I would have to start waking up at 5:00. Since Marina starts at 9:00, I sleep at 10:00. Now I would have to sleep earlier than that. I also want to make new friends like I said, since most of my friends are going to different schools from me. I want my teachers to be nice and hopefully not as strict.
