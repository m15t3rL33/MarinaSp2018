                <p> In 8th grade I want to perfect my algebra skill because I believe it will play a big role in the future. For example if I want to work in finance when I grow up. Another reason why I want to perfect Algebra is because its my worst subject and when I do good on tests I feel very rewarded and accomplished. I just think its very rewarding when you can do a math problem without asking the teacher.Something that you might not know about me is that I love to do math. I love to solve problems that make my mind think and use strategy to solve, and when I complete the problem and get it correct I feel rewarded<p>
            <p>In 9th grade I want to learn how to swim because its a very important to skill in life because if there was a tsunami then I would be able to learn how to swim and not sink and drown in the water. Swimming is also a good excersise and sport and burns a lot of calories, so if I swim every day ill look like Michael Phelps and be able to get a lot of girls to like me because I will have a 6 pack and have a lot of muscles. The reason I dont know how to swim now is because I dont like public pools because I have a phobia of urine in the pool. The idea of swimming in somebodys urine infested water is gag worthy.<p>
                <p>In 10th grade I want to learn how to play an instrument. An instrument that I think is interesting to play is the guitar. I think the reason for this is because my favorite idol plays the guitar and he sounds and plays very nice. I also think that learning an instrument is a good hobby and a very good skill. I need a new hobby because all I do after school is hang out with my friends and eat food and gossip about people. Learning how to play a new instrument would be time consuming but would also be very good to impress people<p>
