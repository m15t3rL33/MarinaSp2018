 3.Where you are
 4.One more chance
 5.Torture
        <h5> The reason why the Jackson 5's are my favorite band is because I feel like I can really relate to their songs and also I like to listen to it when i'm sad because when I do listen to it makes me feel brighter and happie. Not only that but I also like their voices and I like old music in general because it has a lot of history to it. The jackson 5's are no longer a band today but they still enjoy music and often play together.It makes me very happy when I can relate to something that is a song and not to just a regular quote because it makes me feel like songs are better than just regular quotes. I also prefer really old style music more than modern pop music because I think it has more meaning and APPROPIATE LYRICS.<h4>
