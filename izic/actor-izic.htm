        <p><b>My favorite actor is</b><i> Nick Robinson</i></p>
                <p>Nick Robinson is an inspiring human being. He's inspired people not only to be themselves but to also be proud of themselves. Nick Robinson is an actor in the movie "Love,Simon". He plays as the main character Simon and has a secret to himself, which is being gay. The moral of the movie is that you shouldnt be afraid to come out being who you want to be or who you shouldnt be. At the start of the movie he explains and shows why it might be hard to show other people who you are or who you want to be. Then at the end he comes out to all of his friends and family and regrets the choice of not coming out sooner.<p>
                    <p><i>Nick Robinson has taught the whole wide world something in just a two hour movie. Nick Robinson was able to teach people to be proud of they are and to not care about what other people think. This is why the movie "Love,Simon" is such a remarkable and inspiring movie because you can learn so much from it and it can change how you view other people and also how you view yourself. It's astonishing how one person was able to teach other people and to be able to make other people inspired in just a two hour movie. Not only is he just an inspirational actor he also speaks a lot in interviews with show hosts.</i> <p>
                        <p><b>Imagine if more people like Nick Robinson were able to produce films like his in Hollywood. Imagine all of the worlds most remarkable and inspiring people constructed in one movie were created. If this were to be possible I think more people will not only be smarter but also be kinder to one another. The reason why I think this is because one person was able to change millions of peoples mental state and minds. Just imagine what would happen if three or five people were put in a film that was made to inspire and teach people just like Nick Robinson did. People like Nick Robinson. Television shows are made to entertain and make people curious right? What if there was a television show that was able to not only entertain but also to teach and inspire just like the movie "Love,Simon".</b><p>
