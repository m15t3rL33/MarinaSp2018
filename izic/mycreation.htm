                <p> This is the story of when I broke my leg<p>
                <p>When I was eight years old I was at a local park near my house. It was a nice hot sunny day and me and mom were going to have a play date with my friend Sean and his mom. The park was right across from my house and I often went to that park when I was young due to the fact that I didnt like to play with toys and I loved to be active. Since me and my mom lived across the street it would'nt take long to go to the park. But Sean lived in oakland so it took over thirty minutes to get here. It was a real pain in the butt and I was very impatient. Me and Sean both met a local park when I still lived in oakland and weve been childhood friends ever since.<p>
                <p> It took over an hour for Sean and his mom to come to my house. Since there was a lot of traffic he couldnt come as fast as he could. Sean was a very big kid for an eight year old and we couldn't see eachother often since he lived so far away, but we cherished every second we had together. Once Sean reached my house me and my mom went to the park. While our moms were talking together and drinking wine, me and Sean went to the play stucture. The play structure at the time wasnt meant for a kid my size considering how small I was at the age, but it was perfect for Sean since he was so big.<p>
                <p><i>Sean was not the best kid I have to say and was considered a bad influence among my sisters. While me and Sean were playing on the structure there was a space where kids would jump over. Sean leaped over the four feet gap like it was no problem. While I the four feet kid myself was struggling Sean kept urging me to jump over and kept calling me mean names. I didnt want to show Sean I wasnt scared but it was a trembling sight. I jumped gracefully but also with my eyes closed. And when I landed something cracked. I cried for my life since the tormenting like pain hurted so much. Our mothers heard me and Sean screech for our lives as we cried for help because we didnt know what to do.</i><p>
                <p><b>My mother was careless while Seans mom was overprotective. My mother thought it would just heal back if I just rested. While Seans mother had the police on her phone ready to dial and call. I cried to mother so much that she decided that it was probably the right idea to consider it as emergency. That was also the day where I went to the hospital for my first time. It took about two to three months for my leg to fully recover and heal. But after that I never wanted to talk to Sean again. Looking back at the situation I was pretty proud of myself for making the choice and now I still have my two legs and im perfectly fine.</b><p>
