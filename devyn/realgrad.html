<h1>I think high school's expectations are going to be really big. Teachers every year tell me that it is nothing like middle school and it will be way more challenging where you cannot play around a lot and I agree with that. Going into 9th grade, I expect to learn stuff to prepare for the rest of high school. I think that it will take some time to get used to especially since I may have to make new friends and learn how to get through the school. Regardless, I think I will enjoy being a freshman. Maybe.</h1>



    <h1>10th grade. Double digits. Knowing that I won't be the new guy anymore, is awesome. I think in 10th grade it will be more smoother than 9th because I will be used to my surroundings and I know what to expect going through the year. Some of the stuff I had to do in 9th grade I won't really have to do in 10th. Such as ask where all the classes are every day for the first 2 weeks. I do expect it to be way harder than 9th because they expect us to get the feel of high school so I think we will have to do a lot of hard assignments.  </h1>
    
    
    <h1>Graduation from high school is almost there. 11th grade I think will be the hardest grade of all the grades. I say this because I think 12th grade will mostly be about prep for college. 11th grade I won't be worried about being lost around the school at all as in 10th you may have to go to that one spot you didn't go to in 9th. I should know the school by heart now that i've been here for over 2 years. There may also be those extra activities like showing the upcoming high schoolers around during the school tour months and telling them how good of a school it is. </h1>
    
    
    <h1>Graduation is now super close. One more year to go through before you're out of there. Most of 12th grade will be about college preparation I think. About what you're going to be doing in college and what it's going to be like. A quarter of the year will also be graduation practicing so that should be long and really boring. When it gets there though, it will be really worth it. It's a long journey through high school, but I can do it. </h1> </font>
