<title>My previous years in middle school.</title>

<h1><p>My previous years in middle school have been ok. I didn't expect the years to go by so quickly. It was fun to come to school(sometimes) and something funny always happened. Now that I'm in 8th grade I am almost leaving. This is going to be about my previous years in middle school.</h1></p>

<h1><p>6th grade, the first year, started well. I had made some friends and was getting used to my classes. The periods had confused me because we only had 2 classes in 5th grade. To have 7 different teachers took some time to get used to. I enjoyed that 5th grade was a preparation for 6th, but I think 6th was easier than 5th. 6th in general was fairly easy and I went on to 7th.</h1></p>

<h1><p>   7th grade was a quiet and chill year. There were way harder teachers(except math)and assignments, but I got through it. They were a pain. My social studies and english teacher was very hard, but also very funny. My science teacher had a new project when another ended. It was chaos., but also fun. One thing I did not like about 7th grade was that it felt like the school year was going really slowly. The year took forever to end. There wasn't really any other problem with 7th grade. It was a year I got through though.</h1></p>

<h1><p>Those years were very fun and cool. I had met new friends and did new things. The only big thing I would change was the pace of the year. Other than that, I enjoyed it. I hope high school is the same.(It won't be. I think. I mean they said that about middle school, but it wasn't much different.)</h1></p>
