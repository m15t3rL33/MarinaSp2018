<h1><p>YouTube as a career will be hard to maintain successfully. Luckily, my 2nd career choice is also very fun and cool. Before I started getting really into YouTube, I was always a fan of sports. Especially baseball, basketball,and hockey. I have the most experience in baseball because I used to play in leagues around the city. I also watch the Giants daily when they are playing.(Not the NY Giants. That’s football.) </h1></p>

<h1><p>I choose this instead of being a doctor or something like that because those don’t seem to interest me. I don’t go on TV looking for the latest doctor show, I go on to look for sports. The thing about trying to be a doctor is you have to stay in college studying for like 7 years. I want to be in college as least of a time I can. Sports, can shorten your time at college.</h1></p>

<h1><p> Some things I like about baseball is that it is slow paced unlike basketball,soccer,etc. Baseball is really simple. Someone hits the ball then another person fields it. (I know it’s not that simple,but that is the main idea.) I love how simple it is because I won’t get so confused on what to do.</h1></p>
