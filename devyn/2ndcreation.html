<title>2nd Creation</title>
<h1><p> Another creation I did was a castle in Minecraft. It wasn’t just any castle, it connected throughout the whole map. I got help from other people as well. I did it on ps4 (PlayStation 4). This was made a few years ago.</h1></p>

<h1><p> I created this because I was bored. I asked some people if they wanted to help and they said yes. So we spent hours building and breaking. We had to stop to take breaks as well. I was just playing Minecraft, bored when I decided to build a castle. So then I wasn’t bored anymore.</h1></p>

<h1><p>People like Minecraft because it is very original. Also, it is kid friendly so anyone can play and not risk seeing anything bad. The game is also endless so you cannot beat the game so you continuously playing. One big reason is because it is not that expensive.  This is why people like Minecraft.  </h1></p>
