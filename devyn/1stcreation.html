<title>1st Creation</title>
<head><i>First Creation</head></I>
 <h1><p>Something I created before was a weird comic strip series. It was a “Slender Man” series with stick figures. Sometimes I still make new ones. I started making these comics back in 6th grade because I was bored at times. I literally named the series “Slender Man.”</h1></p>

<h1><p>I’ve made about 3 seasons and I actually enjoy doing it. Stick figures are easier to draw and more quick so I do that. More detailed people will take longer and will lead to having less time to get further. Also, if I were to draw more detailed people, the chances of making a mistake and having to leave eraser marks on my paper are higher. The more clean the better.</h1></p>

<h1><p>Why is this my number 1 creation? I chose this as my number 1 because it is the biggest creation that I spent the most time on. The fact that it is an ongoing creation makes it even better. I always liked comic books or graphic novels whenever I get to read one. Especially “Big Nate”, the graphic novel(s).
</h1></p>

<h1><p> What are some bad stuff about this creation? Some downfalls about this creation is that it will not be famous. It won’t be in bookstores at all.
Unless I get permission from the creators,it will be copyright. This is some bad or downfalls of my creation.</h1></p>
