<title>Why I enjoy sports and why I like playing in them.</title>

<h1><p> Sports is one of the most entertaining things in life. Without it I don’t know what I would do. It is hard to choose which I want to watch.  As I said before, I enjoy baseball the most. Now I will explain to you when and why I started watching sports.</h1></p>

<h1><p> I started watching sports when I was a baby. I was taken to Giants games and watched it on tv. Usually babies are forced to watch games until they are old enough to not want to go. I wanted to keep going as I got older. I just seemed to really enjoy watching sports.</h1></p>

<h1><p> When I got a bit older I started watching ALL of the Bay Area sports teams. Whenever I get home I turn on the tv and go to ESPN or some other sports channel. My dad tells me I can go watch a show or something, but I say no and continue watching sports. I grab some snacks and pour some sofa and start watching. This is what usually happens when I get home./h1></p>

<h1><p> I play baseball in a youth league. I have been in it for 4 years and loved it. Every WEDNESDAY I have practice at 5:30 and most Saturdays I have a game. The league is called “SFYBL".  Also known as “San Francisco Youth Baseball League”. I would play hockey, but I'm not that good at ice skating.  </h1></p>
