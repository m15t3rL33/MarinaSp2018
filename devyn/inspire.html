    <title>Who Inspires Me</title>


<h1>What inspires me...</h1>
    
    <p><h1> Successful Video game streamers/Youtubers inspire me to be one of them one day. A lot of people are inspired to become a successful Youtuber/streamer. One of them is me. Im inspired to be a Youtuber/streamer because I enjoy gaming. I don't remember when I started playing video games or anything like that. When I really got into video games was when I got an XBOX 360. I played a bunch of XBOX and then when the PS4 came out, I got that. Ever since I got my Playstation I always thought to be a Youtuber or Streamer. Then when I started playing "Fortnite" and started seeing streamers and Youtubers like DrLupo, Myth, Ninja, CDNThe3rd,etc I wanted to be one even more.</h1><p>

           <p> <h1>CDNThe3rd also known as "CEEZ" is my biggest inspiration. He is a very innapropriate guy, but is very funny. He is the most entertaining streamer no matter what he plays in my opinion.He streams pretty late, but sometimes I stay up all night to watch him. When I watch him I usually eat a snack with it. I know I can be entertained while eating if watching him.</h1><p>

    <h1><p> People inspire by doing stuff others cannot or don't know how to do. For example, if you are really good at basketball, you most likely inspire someone that wants to play basketball/learn to play basketball. CDNThe3rd is a very good Twitch streamer so he inspires me to be a streamer. I can inspire my smaller brother and sister to be a good gamer. In fact, my brother is already really good at Fortnite. He is level 36 and at the tier where he unlocks Best Mates emote and he's only 5.<p></h1>
