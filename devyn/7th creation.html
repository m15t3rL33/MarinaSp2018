<title>What would I do if I can travel through time?</title>

<h1><p>Time travel can be a good and bad thing. It all depends on how you use it. Time travel can be used to go back in time or to the future. Some people use it for revenge or to stop their past self from making a mistake. I am going to explain what I would do if I could time travel and what is good and bad about it.
    
<h1><p>Lets start off with a bad thing. This can mess up your whole future. If you mess something up, it can lead to something that would never happen if you didn't do it.Lets say your friend has died and you want to get him or her back. You can go back in time and save your friend instead of your brother from falling, but then your brother dies. Then when you go back to the present, your friend will be alive and your brother will now be dead.
    
<h1><p>A good thing is the opposite of the other paragraph. You can save someone that you prefer more and live a better life. Knowing that, the person you prefer is still alive. Another good one is you can change your future. If you got hit with a ball then you can go back in time and dodge it from happening.
    
    <h1><p>What would I do? I would go to the future and see how I die. Then I can go back and prevent that from happening. When I prevent that, I can live the life I want to. This is what I would do if I can time travel.
