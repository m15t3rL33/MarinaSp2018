<p>The Spongebob Squarepants Movie inspired me to chase my dreams in a weird way. It may not seem like it, but I saw this movie a lot of times. It's a really old movie that I seem to enjoy everytime I see it. It was even released the year I was born. Which is really cool. Spongebob and Patrick always made/make me laugh. </p>

<p>I learned that sometimes the underdogs win or if you are an underdog, you still can win.Plankton had a great chance to win and takeover everyone, but Spongebob stopped him. Nobody believed that Spongebob would beat Plankton. At one point he didn't believe in himself, but Spongebob won.(Underdog=A competitor that has a slim chance of winning.)</p>
    
 <p><b> Spongebob deserves to be a Hollywood movie because the movie is very funny and entertaining. Spongebob is a kid friendly show/movie so any child can find him entertaining. Spongebob can even make adults laugh in some occasions. Families love watching Spongebob together. This is why Spongebob should be a Hollywood movie.
