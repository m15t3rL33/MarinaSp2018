   <p> <b style="Color: yellow;"> Tom Kenny spoke to me because Tom Kenny played the main character(Spongebob) and he matched the personality of Spongebob perfectly. The voice of Spongebob was a weird sound, but it was cool. Tom is also a voice actor in Adventure Time. A show I used to watch. Tom Kenny is a very entertaining guy when he's a voice actor. He can make all types of different voices which is cool. Most the voices Tom does I end up watching. I like him from Spongebob the most, of course. </p>
    
    <p> <b style="color: yellow;">I learned that you can entertain in a different way. Tom entertained people without actually acting behind cameras. Being a voice actor seems pretty hard knowing the fact that you have to be able to sound in that situation even though you're not in it.(Ex. Sounding like you're scared even though you're not scared.) It seems pretty hard to do it. To be good at it, is a great achievement. To play Spongebob is a big role because so many people watch it all the time. Tom kept the fanbase alive even though he's been the same voice actor for Spongebob ever since 1999.</p>
   
<p> Tom Kenny should be in Hollywood movies because he is one of the most kid friendliest voice actors I know. You can rely on him to keep a series going when it looks like it's going to shut down. Here is some kid friendly shows he voice acted in: Spongebob Squarepants (1999-2018),Adventure Time (2010-2018),We Bare Bears (2018), Uncle Grandpa (2013-2017), and Clarence (2013-2017). As you can see Tom went for many years in all except "We Bare Bears." Tom puts years in the shows he voice acts in and does a good job at it too.</p>
