<title>Vacations to Reno

<h1>There was always this place I went to many times when I was younger for vacation . It was always by car and was a nice ride. There was a lot of snow there and a arcade I really enjoyed. We even went snowboarding at times. This place was called Reno.

When going to Reno everyone got to enjoy the scenery. The mountains covered with snow. Occasionally we would have to go to a rest stop to use the bathroom and get snacks. The best part about going to the rest stops was there was usually snow there. I would make snowballs and throw it at stuff. We would continue to journey on.

The first place we would go to is called “Boomtown”(I think). There is a little arcade area there and a casino. When we got there we would settle down and unpack our stuff. One thing I would do before is make sure I brought my snow gloves. We would end up staying there for a few hours then go to then go to the snow areas.

After the snow area we would go to this way bigger arcade. It was called “Circus Circus”(I think). Everyone would play there for a while. They also had a bowling alley that was fun. After some time I would turn in my tickets for prizes. Finally we would go back to the hotel and travel back home.</h1>
