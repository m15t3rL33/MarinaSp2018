            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <p>My life, alright i was born in November 17,2003. I have a brother and a half-sister, I am the youngest one in my family. My mom left us when we were very little. My dad has been taking care of my brother and I. My sister went to her actual dad. We moved to San Fransico. We moved to San fransico in december 23, 2012. We started in a shelter and stayed there for at least a year and we got an apartment. The elementary that I went to was Spring Valley Science School. From there I went to Spring Valley Science School for two years and now i'm in Marina Middle School. Which partly leads where I am now. </p>
