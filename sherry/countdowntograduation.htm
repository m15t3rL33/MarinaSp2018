<h1><center>Countdown to Graduation</center>

<body>    
    
<p><h3>There are approximately 4 years and 2 months until high school graduation. Before graduation comes, I want to make sure that my grades are high. Everybody will be excited about graduation. Most people will start thinking about college when the last few months of 12th grade. There is still plenty of time until we  graduate.
    
<p><h3>
    
<p><h3>In high school, there are many graduation requirements. Every time a new school year starts, we have summer reading. When the year starts, we take a test to prove that we read the book and understood the concept. For example, we are required to read a book called "A Child Called It" by Dave Pelzer before 9th grade begins. There are also class requirements, such as taking 2 years of world language.
