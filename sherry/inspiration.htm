<p><h1><b><center>My Inspiration</center></b></h1>
   
<p><h3>What inspires me is my mother. Everyday, she goes into work to support my family. Although she might be tired, she would still give it 100% at her job. She inspires me to never give up and to work harder. She helps me do my best at school and to try my hardest. If I have a job in the future and get stuck, I would think about how my mother tried her hardest to get through it and provide food for the family.</h3>
 
<p><h3>Thinking about my future is also inspiring. Thinking about what is going to happen next can inspire me to do my best during the present time. For example, if I'm taking a test and I'm stuck on a hard question, I wouldn't give up. Instead, I would try my best to answer the question, no matter how hard it is. If my future depends on this test, I would think about what would happen if I get a good grade on it, rather than failing it.</h3>
    
<p><h3>We can inspire people in many ways. We, 8th graders, can inspire the 6th and 7th graders. They might look up to us. We could be a role model for them by showing them how they should be acting and behaving. When we behave poorly, the grades below us might think that it's okay. We can inspire them to do the right thing and behave the right way.</h3>
