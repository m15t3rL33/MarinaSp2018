<h3><p>A fan is used to help you cool off on a hot, sunny day. One type of fan is the electric fan. Fans were first invented between the years of 1882 and 1886. It was first invented by a man named Schuyler Skaats Wheeler. Schuyler Skaats Wheeler was an electrical engineer who created the first electric fan, along with other electrical devices.</h3>

<h3><p>In my engineering class, I created another version of the electric fan. It required a plastic bottle, a battery, two wires, propellers, electrical tape and a drive shaft. I cut the a water bottle in half, keeping the top portion. Then, I cut slits as holes for the wires to be able to reach the battery. The red wire is positive an the blue wire is negative. Therefore, the red wire goes on the positive side of the battery, and the blue wire goes on the negative side of the battery. I cut a hole on the cap for the drive shaft and propellers to go through.</h3>

<h3><p>I decided to make an electric fan because it's portable and easy to carry around. It's portable and you can keep it in your pocket for whenever you need it.
