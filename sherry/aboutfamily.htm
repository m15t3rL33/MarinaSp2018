<h1><b><center>About my Family</center></b></h1>

<h3><p>The history behind my family isn't very interesting. I don't know much about my family, because I've never seen or met my great grandparents before. I've never been close to my father's side of the family because they live in another country. I haven't visited the country in approximately 9 years. I haven't talked or communicated with them since the last 9 years I visited them. Everyone in my family was born in China, whereas I was born here in San Francisco.</h3>

<h3><p>On the other hand, I know much more about my mother's side of the family than my father's side. My mother has 2 biological siblings, an older brother and an older sister. They're all happily married with 2 kids. From my mother's side of the family, I have 4 cousins and 1 second cousin. All my cousins are older than me, besides my second cousin, meaning that I'm the second youngest in my family.</h3>

<h3><p>My older brother was born approximately 24 years ago. He's about 10 years and 6 months older than me, but we've learned how to deal with the age difference over the past 14 years. He's a great older brother. He helps me with anything that I need, such as homework. He has a wonderful job that will allow him to earn money.<h3>

<h3><p>It's easy being the second child, because my parents have already learned to deal with raising one child. They have experience with parenting, meaning that I wouldn't be as hard to take care of. I was happy about being the second child, but that meant that if I had a younger sibling, I would be the middle child. I've always had mixed feelings about a younger brother or sister. I wanted one because I would be able to take responsibility and take care of him or her, but I also didn't want one because that would mean I couldn't have my own room.</h3>
