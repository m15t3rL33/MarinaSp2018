<h3><p>My experience with coding hasn't been much of a journey. In sixth grade, I learned to code on Scratch. Then, I learned to code on the AI program in seventh grade. Now in 8th grade, my engineering class taught me to code in Processing. We are currently learning HTML and CSS coding.</h3>

<h3><p>The first time I learned to code was in sixth grade. My sixth grade computer science teacher taught me to code on Scratch. I didn't think it was much of a challenge because we were only using building blocks. It wasn't nearly the same as typing code. We had blocks that we dragged into our work section and selected options for it.</h3>

<h3><p>The coding I learned in seventh grade was also very simple. We learned to code on the AI coding program. It was also easy, because there were still building blocks in use. We still haven't learned to code by typing yet. This was different from Scratch, because there were different interference blocks. The outcome of the two different coding sites were also very different.</h3>

<h3><p>What I learned in eight grade has so far been my favorite. We started to code by typing. Processing consisted of numbers and graphing. There were shapes, colors and sizes to create by graphing. HTML and CSS has been different, because the coding styles weren't the same. We learned basic and simple HTML and CSS, such as changing the font of the text and background color.</h3>
