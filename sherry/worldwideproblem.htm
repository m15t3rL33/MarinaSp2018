<h1><b><center>Pollution</center></b></h1>

<h3><p>A problem that we have all around the world is pollution. Pollution is found everywhere, from in the air to the sea. Pollution is a terrible thing because it causes problems that we can't solve. The only way we can prevent these problems from happening is to stop the pollution. It would be hard to stop, because we keep doing what experts tell us to stop doing, such as using gas and throwing plastic into the ocean.</h3>

<h3><p>One problem that pollution causes is extinction. One way we cause pollution in the ocean is by throwing garbage in it. Another way is from the technology that we use. Chemicals from the technology that pollute the water cause living things to die out as it spreads into the ocean. Temperatures are considered pollutants if they are artificially introduced, which also cause extinctions. Due to the major temperature changes, some of the living things are unable to handle it.</h3>

<h3><p>Air pollution is a problem for living things. Air pollution is caused by burning fossil fuels. For example, the coal, oil, and gasoline we use for electricity and vehicles cause air pollution. The gasoline in our buses and cars cause a major amount of air pollution. Air pollution is a problem because too much air pollution exposure can cause cancer and damage our bodies. In some deadly cases, it can even cause death.</h3>

<h3><p>To reduce air pollution, we must conserve energy. To do that, we must remember to turn off all of our electric powered appliances when they are not in use. For example, we must remember to turn off our lights and computers when we don't need to use them. To reduce water pollution, we should conserve water. To do that, we should turn it off when we aren't using it, such as brushing our teeth and applying shampoo. We should also be careful about what we flush down the toilet. We should also be careful about what we throw into the ocean.</h3>
