<h2><p><i>You have the ability to hack into the school computer system. You can change people's grades. Would you change your own? Why or why not? What if you could change the grade for a basketball player who has a scholarship to play for a big university?</i></h2>

<h3><p>If I had the ability to hack into the school computer system, I wouldn't. Even if I had  a bad grade, I would change it the right way, which is to work hard in that class to raise the grade. I've decided that I wouldn't hack into the computer system because it isn't right. It's wrong to hack into something in the first place, let alone hacking into the school computer system. If I'm doing it to change grades that people must work hard to earn, it would cause people to be lazy and stop doing their work.</h3>

<h3><p>I would be tempted to hack in and help people change their grades, but I wouldn't because it isn't the right thing to do. No matter how many people would ask me to change their grade, I would just tell them that they would have to earn their grade the right way. If they need help with anything, I would help them if they're trying to do the right thing. For example, I would help people study with flashcards. Helping people for tests and quizzes would be the better thing to do than to hack in to change their grades.</h3>

<h3><p>If a basketball player with a scholarship to play for a big university asked me to change their grade, I would still stay with my decision to deny it. It would still be wrong to help the player. If I help him or her, other people would say it's unfair. The basketball player should also work hard to get the grades. If they need help academically, I would also help them with whatever they're stuck on, such as I would with anybody else.</h3>

<h3><p>If I were to hack in the school computer system and raise everyones' grades, there would be major consequences if I get caught. For example, if I get caught, I would get in major trouble with the school districts and government. It would be a huge crime for two reasons. One is hacking into a school system, and the other reason is tampering with the government's way of separating the good students from the ones who don't work as hard as the others. I could get expelled or sent to juvy. If I get expelled, it would be hard to get a job. It could be a long term situation. Overall, I believe that it would be a terrible idea to change people's grades.</h3>
