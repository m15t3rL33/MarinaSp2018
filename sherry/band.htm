<h1><p><b><center>My Favorite Band: Why Don't We</center></b></p></h1>
        
<h2><p><i><center>Genre of Music: Pop</center></i></p></h2>
    
<p><h3>Music plays a big role in our lives. Music can completely change the mood 
    
<p><h3>Why Don't We is my favorite band because they have inspired many people to do things they never thought they could. For example, they inspired their fans to achieve things and never give up. Another reason why they are my favorite is that they create and put out great music. All of their songs are in the pop music genre, but they write songs that fit with all of the different moods. A few of them are Something Different, Invitation, Free, Turn it Off, and On My Way.</h3>
