<h1><p><b><center>Main Actor: Jacob Tremblay</center></b></p></h1>
    
<p><h3>Jacob Tremblay played the main role in the movie Wonder. His character is named August Pullman. August Pullman's character showed a lot of emotions, such excited or lonely. Tremblay spoke out to me because he did a great job, playing the role of the main character. Tremblay's acting job on those emotions felt real and genuine.</h3>
    
<p><h3> His character is an inspiration because he shows that bullying can do a lot of damage to a person's mental health. This should teach people that bullying is a terrible thing to do and shouldn't be considered. This actor has taught me that we should stand up for people who are being bullied. We shouldn't be just another bystander because it wouldn't help them in any way. Stepping up and helping someone out would affect their life in a good way.</h3>
