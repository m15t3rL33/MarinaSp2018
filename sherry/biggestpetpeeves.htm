<h3><p>There are many things that annoy people. When someone is annoyed, they could be rude and angry. For example, when people chew with their mouth open, it's rude and disrespectful. It annoys people because it isn't a pretty view of what they are chewing. When people do things that aren't polite, it annoys people.</h3>

<h3><p>One of my biggest pet peeves is when people have terrible grammar.  For example, it's common for people to use “your” instead of “you're”. Another common mistake is using “to” instead of “too”. This annoys me because they should've learned the correct usage of grammar in elementary school. When people correct other peoples’ grammar, it's annoys me, but I would've also done the same.</h3>

<h3><p>Another thing that annoys me is when I scratch a chalkboard with my nails. It has an outcome of the weirdest feeling. It also makes an annoying screeching noise that would drive people nuts. It makes people feel weird and uncomfortable. A wall being scratched is also annoying, but isn't as uncomfortable to sit through as a chalkboard being scratched with nails.</h3>

<h3><p>When people don't cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze, it's also uncomfortable. Coughing and sneezing in public isn't a problem. When people cough or sneeze without covering their mouth, their germs spread everywhere. It causes me to feel disgusted and grossed out. You shouldn't be in the same building as someone who is sick, so therefore, covering their mouth is the least they can do.</h3>
