<h1><p><b><center>My&nbsp;&lt;&gt;Favorite Movie: Wonder</center></b></p></h1>
       
<h3>Wonder is a great movie because it speaks and stands out. The storyline is inspirational. It's about a  little boy who had to undergo many surgeries because he was born with a few problems. He has been to private school up until the 5th grade. After 4th grade, he decided that it was time for a change. He wanted to experience public school before going into middle school. He was nervous on the first day, but met a friend that helped him along his journey in public school.</h3>
    
<p><h3>This movie teaches us that a simple action, such as befriending someone, can change the course of their lives. This movie shows how much bullying can affect one's mental health. The mental health of someone is a big part of their life. This movie shows that you should stand up for someone being bullied, because it could change the victim's perspective.  </h3>
