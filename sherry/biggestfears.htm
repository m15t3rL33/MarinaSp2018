<h3><p>There are a big variety of phobias in the world. Phobias are fears that people are extremely scared of. Some of the most common phobias are acrophobia and arachnophobia. Acrophobia is the fear of heights and being on high-elevated places. The fear of spiders is known as arachnophobia. If these phobias become too extreme, terrible things could happen, such as panic attacks.</h3>

<h3><p>One of my biggest fears are spiders and insects. The scientific name for a fear of spiders is arachnophobia. A fear of insects is known as entomophobia. If I see a bug at my house, I would always ask my parents to come and kill it. I've gotten better at staying calm when I see a bug, but I still wouldn't want it to stay there. The worst part is when they never move when you're awake, but they're gone when you wake up.</h3>

<h3><p>Another one of my biggest fears is heights. Acrophobia is a fear of mine, because it wouldn't be the best thing in the world to fall. When you look down and see a great view, it could cause some people to feel dizzy. When you know that falling is a possibility, you would try your best not to. If Iâ€™m on an airplane and I look out the window, I wouldn't be scared because I know that the chances of falling are very low.</h3>

<h3><p>Another one of my fears are small spaces. Small spaces, also known as claustrophobia, scare me because there isn't much room to move. When there is a tight space, it makes people feel uncomfortable. When claustrophobic people are in small spaces, it could cause panic attacks. Many people hate being in confined spaces.</h3>
