<h1><b><center>About Me</center></b><h1>
    
<h3>My name is Sherry and I was born on October 22 in San Francisco. On my free days, I would stay at home to watch movies and catch up on tv shows or hang out with my friends. Some of my favorite TV shows are 'Riverdale' and 'The Flash'. They have great storylines that keep the watchers intrested. The cliffhangers at the end of each episode leave the watcher wanting to come back for the next one.</h3>
    
<h3>When I was younger, I wanted to be a gymnast, but my parents would never agree to take me to gymnastic classes. I decided that I wanted to be a self-taught gymnast, so everyday, I would try to aquire a new skill. I remember when I was excited the first time that I succeeded in doing the splits or doing a backflip. I was excited because I never thought that I'd be able to achieve the skills when I just started teaching myself. I also surprised myself with how much I could actually learn by myself.</h3>
    
<h3>One thing that I've been obsessed with my whole life are dogs. Ever since I was young, I've had a passion for dogs. Some of my favorite breeds are Corgis, Huskies, and Shiba Inus. I've wanted a dog since I was little, but my parents thought that it would be too much for the house. They thought that I wouldn't be able to take of it, since I was too busy with school work.</h3>
