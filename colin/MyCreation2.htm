Usually, my free time is during the weekends. During the weekdays, I would have to do homework which consumes a lot of my time. Once I finish my homework, I usually would have some time to eat and sleep right after I'm done. I usually also have some plans with my friends during the weekends. Spending my time playing basketball and hanging out with my friends. I don't find a lot of time in my day to draw, but I find enough time needed to complete at least one. 
<br>
I enjoy spending my time with my friends. I have a good time when hanging out with my friends and I wouldn't be able to keep track of time, so weekends go by pretty fast. With my friends, I can definitely never get bored because there's a variety of things to do. On the weekends, I can just take a break from work and do what I want to do. I look forward to the weekends because thinking about school easily stresses me out.
<br>
Sometimes when I don't hang out with my friends, I would go online and try to practice graphics designer with a free program. I don't have any equipment to help me draw, so I only have a keyboard and a mouse. It's extremely hard to draw with a mouse since I have to continuously hold down the left click button to draw. I wouldn't even try to get some equipment because I believe it's expensive.
<br>
I also sometimes talk to different friends online. When I have time, I would always go online. The internet is the best place to be when you have nothing to do. You can spend a lot of time on the internet and you wouldn't even know how fast time passes. I would try to have some time to play some online games as well, so I can entertain myself.
