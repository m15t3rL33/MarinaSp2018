<title> World Wide Community Problem </title>
<center>
<header> <h1> World Wide Community Problem </h1> </header>
<footer>
There are a lot of world wide community problems. From being homeless on the streets to the weather. Some cities have weird weather that affect the lives of many people living in it. Hot, humid weather might affect how people work that work outside, such as construction workers. There are many cities filled with homeless people who are in need of places to live. A homeless person is extremely common to encounter if you’re in a normal neighborhood. 
<br>
Fixing the problem of being homeless would be a very hard thing to do. Fixing the problem would require many shelters being made that may need to provide water. There isn’t an infinite water supply in cities, so it would cost a lot to give thousands of homeless people some water. It is still solvable if you would only give free shelter and not the water. That would decrease the amount of people living in the streets, and in free shelter instead.
<br>
Fixing weather, on the other hand, wouldn’t be as hard, but might still cost a lot to make. Some cities may have hot, humid weather, and others may be extremely cold and cloudy. To fix the problem of cloudy weather, you would need many powerful wind generators to blow away the clouds. That’s possible because I’ve seen it before. To fix the hot weather is completely different. You would need to generate cold air around the city, which might need many giant fans. That would use a lot of electrical energy and money.
<br>
Fixing any world wide community problems would cost a lot of money. If it’s cheap or even free, most world wide community problems would already be solved and no one would need to worry about it. Money is something that is required in many things, like manufacturing and shipping the products might be a hassle. Shipping products isn’t free and can cost a lot. Manufacturing the products is definitely not free and can cost a fortune.
