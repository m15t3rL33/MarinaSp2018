I enjoy drawing for a variety of things. You get to immerse yourself into your own world. You can make your imagination come to life on a small piece of paper. You can draw whatever you want without any rules. There's no competition to become the best artist in the world, it wouldn't really matter. Possibilities are endless when it comes to drawing things. There is nothing you can't do in terms of art. Every inch of your imagination can be easily drawn if you can try hard enough.
<br>
Drawing is your creativity to its fullest extent. Drawing can be easily practiced an improved. I never had a talent to draw on paper. I drew once a few years ago and it was a basic stick figure with a cool smiling face. I started trying to improve my drawing so I started with book covers. I looked at them and drew exactly what I saw on paper. At first it still wasn't good, but as time flew by, it looked good enough for me.
<br>
I don't know the inspiration for why I like drawing and started to draw. It might be not a lot of people can draw well, so I decided to do it. It might also be a good way to show off what you can do that not many can. Art can express your feelings in many ways. You can easily tell the emotion of the drawing. For example, a horse rider in the the desert. The artist might be feeling adventurous and want to go in the desert that he/she might have never been in before.
<br>
There is never an end to what you can draw. That is because there is never an end to what you can imagine. The wildest imagination could be drawn onto a piece of paper and can be given life. I have many more reasons for why I draw. However, that list may never end. Drawing, for me, is what I like to do when I'm feeling bored and having nothing to do. Drawing, for me, is what I use to impress others and to give a good impression of myself.
