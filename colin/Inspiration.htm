            My inspiration to continue on my life was mostly my family, like any average person. Any inspirational and famous people don't really inspire me a lot. My family helped me a lot and they helped me personally to achieve what I achieved. My parents gave me an education and I'm grateful for that. They also care about me. They helped me with the problems I had throughout life and I'm thankful for that. They made changed my once ungrateful self, into a better human being and someone that is responsible.
            <br>
           Another thing that inspires me is some of my friends. Certain friends helped me a lot and I changed a lot from them as well. I usually only get to see my family for a few hours a day, so they don't get to talk to me too often. However, I talk to my friends a lot. I have fun with them, I talk to them, and they helped me a lot in many things. They helped me improve my education and soon, I surpassed them. I still help them out if they need it, as a thanks for the years I had with them.
            <br>
            My inspirations changed my life a lot. There are some people in my life that hasn't changed me at all and just a buddy that I can talk to once in a while. There are also some, not all, people who has been with me for many years, but not everyone is my inspiration. They might have known me for a while, but that's all they are to me. Others that changed my life helped me a lot and I'm grateful to them.
