    <p> The voice actor, Rumi Hiiragi, is a Japanese voice actor for Chihiro Ogino, the main character in <i> Spirited Away </i>. The actor is great because she was able to do many brave things alone and she tries her best trying to save her family. She couldn't return to the human world, but she wasn't too afraid at all. She might've needed to rely on Haku, but that doesn't mean that she couldn't do anything by herself. Many things can be learned from her because she is mature, brave, and she was able to make some friends along her journey. </p>
