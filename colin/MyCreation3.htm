Wolves are definitely one of the most fascinating animals on the planet. They work as a pack to hunt down their prey, leaving blood and bones along the way. Wolves are intelligent and which is the reason why they have survived for so long without going extinct. Only a few predators, especially humans, pose a threat against the wolves.
<br>
Wolves aren't the most favored in the wildlife. With their vicious behavior, they can easily devour a human as a pack. Many humans hunt wolves which led to wolves sealing themselves off from civilization. Wolves live in places away from humans because they are afraid of being hunted. Wolves usually only attack people when they have rabies, which leads to violent movements.
<br>
Dogs are descendants of wolves that went extinct. 800,000 years ago, the evolution of wolves created the first, most similar animal that relates to dogs and gray wolves, which currently the largest population of wolves. The gray wolves population shouldn't be endangered currently because not many humans would hunt wolves, since it's so dangerous.
<br>
The largest wolves to ever live were the dire wolves. Around half the size of a human on its four paws, the dire wolves went extinct almost ten thousand years ago. With its large teeth, it could easily penetrate through a woolly mammoth's skin, however it still has competition. The Sabre-toothed tiger also hunted large mammals as prey. After the Ice Age, many large prey started dying off from climate change and the number of large prey decreased, leading to the extinction of dire wolves.
