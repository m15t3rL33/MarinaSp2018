                In 9th grade, I would either be in George Washington high school or Galileo high school. I would be fine with Washington, but I question the school in Galileo. I heard there were many fights there, disputes, and arguments because of racial identity and their physical appearance. I really don't understand why people would fight others because of that, just to prove that they are stronger than the other or they can only speak with their fists. I'd rather not be disturbed by fights that would get in the way of my studies. 
                    <br>
                    In 10th grade, I probably would try to transfer if I'm in Galileo. If I'm in Washington, I would stay. I don't really have anything against Galileo, but if I were to choose between Galileo or Washington, I would choose Washington without hesistation. My sister is in Galileo and I would rather not be near here because I really don't want to argue for the next 4 years. Washington is also filled with people I know and I'd rather not make friends all over again in Galileo. I would be hard working in 10th grade, doing all my work to advance to the next grade. 
                    <br>
                    I don't think 9th grade would help me advance to 10th grade. 10th grade would teach something completely different from 9th grade. The subjects won't build up on each other. Basic math like algebra might show up in all grades, but that's about it. Math like trigonometry or calculus would be an example that would build up on each other, but that's about it. If I fail calculus, I would probably failed trigonometry as well. However, that's not going to happen because I'm not trying to fail at any subjects.
