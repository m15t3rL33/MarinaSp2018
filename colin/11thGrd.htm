                    In 11th grade, hopefully I would be in the school I want with good grades. I would be thinking that there is only 2 years left, including 11th grade and 12th grade. I would be hoping that time would fly by really fast, like 6th grade to 8th grade. I might be stressed out and losing motivation to go to school. Though I would probably still go to school because my parents would hit me real hard, I don't want to get enough absences that would send me to court, and I want to finish off my years with my friends. 
                    <br>
                    I still don't know my plans for 11th grade or 12th grade. I can't tell the future so I don't know what would happen with me. I might get hit by a car, become a scholar, become a homeless, or become an average high school graduate. I still hope for the best and would try to get the best possible outcomes of every situation that would help me with my life. Like studying art, math, english, chemistry, and other important subjects. I don't think all subjects are necessary like studying chemistry if I'm not trying to become a scientist.

                    Such as, studying art might help with being an designer because of creativity and designs. Studying chemistry on the other hand and trying to become a designer won't help at all because there is no correlation between designing and chemical equations. Unless you're trying to design something that has to do something with balancing chemical equations, there is no point trying to study chemistry if you're trying to be a designer. Subject requirements should'nt be a thing in high school since main subjects branches off into other different, minor, subjects.
