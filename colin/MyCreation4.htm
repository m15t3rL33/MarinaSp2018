I have many fears in my life. From spiders, the future, and wars, to the end of the world. I believe it's common for people to be afraid of spiders. Their eight long legs and the numbers of eyes on their head is just disgusting. They go around spinning web around your house and wherever you go. They can even inject poison into you if itâ€™s the right ones. I'd rather not go close to them or try to murder them as fast as possible.
<br>
I think many people are afraid of the end of humanity. There would be no humans left to run the planet and nuclear power plants would go uncontrolled, which might explode. The animals would run the planet with no resources other than plants and other animals. The predators would dominate the prey and begin to overpopulate. There would be nothing that can defeat the top predator and evolution would begin all over again.
<br>
The future is something very difficult to think about. You wouldn't know what would happen in the future. Advancement in technology would probably happen. Technology would dominate the planet. Artificial intelligence would significantly advance and robots would begin to do many things without being controlled. The future might also be the end of the world. The future is something that can't be predicted.
<br>
War is something that many people are afraid of. Their own country going against another. War is just to show which country has stronger military and sometimes doesn't even solve the problem that caused it in the first place. A few hundred years ago, war was for territory and dominance against other countries. Now, war is just something to spread fear, world dominance, and to solve questionable conflicts.
