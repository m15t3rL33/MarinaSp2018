            I'm pretty confident that he's not in a band or involved with any. I also think he was fairly recent, starting in 2016, so he's underrated. Most of his songs are about controversial topics. He doesn't have that much information.

            Reason(s) why I like it:
            <br>
           I like it because of the lyrics and the rhythm. It fits well and goes together nicely. Doesn't cure your depression or doesn't give any emotions (for me at least). It goes into some really deep topics that might offend some people. It's not offensive unless you're like a social justice warrior.
