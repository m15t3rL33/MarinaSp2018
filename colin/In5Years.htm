                        In one year, I would either be in <a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/en/schools/school-information/galileo.html">Galileo High School</a> or <a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/en/schools/school-information/george-washington.html">George Washington High School</a>. If I'm in Galileo, I would be studying the main subjects and either art or digital art. If I'm in Washington, I don't know what I'm going to do there. It has many different sports programs and I might participate in one of them. The reason why I'm going to participate in digital art in Galileo because I prefer digital art rather than drawing physically since there are many more resources digitally. You would need to buy supplies when trying to draw on a piece of paper and trying to make it a masterpiece. Some art materials are extremely costly and I wouldn't spend so much money on something that I don't really need like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prismacolor-3599TN-Premier-Colored-72-Count/dp/B01FUYR4HM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1523630887&sr=8-3&keywords=prismacolor&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=artfixed-20&linkId=15c0a0a340ac9e5a1b758eb6d326be13">some colored pencils</a>, costing over $30 for a pack of colored pencils because it's made with fine material and well made. Some digital art programs, such as <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>, is free and it's a good program in my opinion because it's free and it has many different tools. It's like a free version of Photoshop, but with less tools, but it's still good since it's free. It only needs the user to remember all the buttons and what they do.

                    I would hope that I would complete 9th grade easily and getting good grades, so I would get into a good college, since in 5 years, I would be in college. If I don't, I probably don't know what I would do. I wouldn't know what I would study after my 9th grade because I don't know how it operates and I don't have any experience in it yet. However, I still hope that 9th grade wouldn't be too hard, but wouldn't be as easy as 8th grade. Well, after I complete high school, I would go to college. That's what my parents want to go, but I don't know if I should. Completely finishing high school should give me enough knowledge on all subjects. Going to college would just make me an expert on some subjects, but would take up 4 years of my life. It would also cost a lot of money, but my parents don't mind it.

                    I don't really have any colleges I prefer, I just want to have a good education. I still question why people would want to go to college. An article, <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/08/09/college-education-worth/">Is College Worth It?</a>, questions if college is really worth 4 years of your life and the  money it requires. In five years, I would probably be in college, in my third year. I would probably be completely exhausted, after consuming almost 20 years of my life for nothing, but education. I would probably have many friends with me that I would know. If I don't go to a school with any friends, I would be lonely and I probably can't make any since I'm an introvert.
