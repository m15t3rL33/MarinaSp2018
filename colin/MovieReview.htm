    <p> <i>
        Japanese voice actor, Rumi Hiiragi, as Chihiro Ogino </i> </p>
        <font size="+1">
    <p>
    The main character, Chihiro, had to go to a different world, a spirit world filled with different monsters and animals, and revert her parents back into humans after an accident was caused. She meets a boy named Haku, who told her that she had entered a spirit world. She had to do everything mostly by herself, finding a way to get out and changing her parents back to normal.</p>
    <p>The movie is great because you can learn many things from such as being "brave". She couldn't return to the human world because a sorceress prevents her from doing so. Chihiro had to rely on Haku to help save her family. Things such as making friends, being brave, and being mature could be learned from this movie.</p>
       <p> <i>Spirited Away</i> didn't need to be made in Hollywood, it could've been anywhere no matter the country and it would've still been a good movie. The movie was executed extremely well by the producers. The animation was well made in Japan. It easily became popular around Japan and immediately around the world because of how well made it was. The characters' personalities and what they did made <i>Spirited Away</i> what it is now.</p>
