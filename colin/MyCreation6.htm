<title> The Mona Lisa </title>

            I don't think the Mona Lisa is a very appealing painting. It was painted by one of the most famous artists, Leonardo da Vinci.It's just my opinion, but I guess it was amazing because it was back in the 1500s during the Renaissance, when pictures had no people smiling. Mona Lisa was the first painting during the Renaissance that had a person smiling, which shows a woman smiling. I definitely think it's hard to paint. It was painted with oil and I don't think I could paint that. I just think the Mona Lisa could've been better.

            The Mona Lisa is definitely one of the most famous paintings on the planet. It's valued at an expensive price because it's been preserved for over 450 years. Leonardo painted this based off of his wife, Mona Lisa. However, the painting just doesn't appeal to me. It doesn't look "real" and it looks like every old painting you could find in a museum. Any ancient art would seem the same as the Mona Lisa to me. I'm not trying to disrespect it, but I don't see why it highly praised.
            <br>
            I feel like the Mona Lisa shouldn't be as high praised as it is. It's just a work of art centuries ago. Just a different emotion of the picture. I don't see anything else other than that. Sure, it's definitely a work of art. However, I believe anyone professional enough would have the ability to recreate this painting. I have a hard time trying to comprehend what this painting is so great.
