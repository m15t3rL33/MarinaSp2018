<title> An Ideal Day</title>

An ideal day is when there's good weather. Nice sunny weather, no clouds, and just the blue sky. It feels great when it’s sunny and enjoying the warmth. When it's rainy, it just feel "nice". The floor is wet, the sky is dark, and there’s disgusting blobs of mud everywhere. It's also cold and doesn't feel great when you can't go outside. It just makes me extremely lazy and gloomy, which isn't the greatest mood in the world. 
<br>
Another thing for an ideal day is when there is no much work to do, both in class and home. I'd rather not work in class and just do what I want to do, just not work. I definitely don't like work at home. I just want to sleep or talk to my friends and not work for the day. I'm already tired from going to school, even if there isn't much work, and it stresses me out. There's already so many events in the future that I just don't want to think about it. Basically, an ideal day is in the weekends.
<br>
The third thing I'd like for an ideal day is when I can hang out with my friends. I like to spend time with my friends because it's great when you can just talk and have fun with each other. Hanging out with friends is something that entertains me the most. Being alone isn't the best thing to do, unless you are an introvert. I'm basically both an introvert and an extrovert.
<br>
The last thing I want for an ideal day is something that isn't "possible". I want extended time for certain days, which isn’t possible because that's not how time and days work. The time in a day is 24 hours, but almost half of that is consumed by sleep. There's only around 15 hours for you to do whatever you want, which isn’t the most time in the world when you don't keep track of time. Extended time is basically to "slow" time, but time can’t be stopped since time keeps moving forward.
