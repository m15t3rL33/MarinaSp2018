If someone steals Apple products and offers me for half the price, I would call the police after I ask him if it was a scam. If he/she shows me the products that were stolen, I would kindly ask for the products and pretend to be a police officer. I probably wouldn’t do though because I wouldn’t know if he/she is carrying a weapon and I’d rather not die for trying to call the police on someone who stole Apple products. I don’t even know how it is even possible to steal Apple products and not have anyone notice.
<br>
It’s actually Apple’s problem because it’s their products, they are selling it, and it’s their fault if they don’t see anyone stealing their products. If someone stole their products, they have bad security and they should probably fix that before anything else happens. So technically, I shouldn't be the one dealing with Apple’s problems and call the polices well. It should be Apple’s security that should be calling the police. 
<br>
However, I'm still nice enough to call the police to have the burglar arrested. I'd rather not get shot if I refused his offer of the products being half price. I wouldn’t want to die for refusing a questionable offer. Then I would probably go to the nearest Apple Store and tell them to fix their security. Anyone that knows how to sneak around the store could probably steal their products and run away with a good amount of money stolen.
<br>
If anyone can actually manage to steal Apple’s products, that would completely surprise me and question how he/she did it. I might want to learn a few tricks and never use it since I’d rather not go to jail for stealing. Avoiding Apple’s security is one thing, but how can one even find the products. Would it be in the storage room, if they even have one, or would it be in the display. No one would dare to steal something in the display shelves because that’s too obvious and would get you arrested instantly.
