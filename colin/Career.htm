The career I’m researching is a digital artist. Most digital artists must have skills, such as computer design, marketing, and web design. Artistic skills is definitely required for any careers that involves art. A bachelor’s degree in visual art is recommended. The median salary for digital artists is $63,970 in 2015, which is less than I expected, however it’s still a good pay for those who might not be the best in digital art, but still good at it.
<br>
A graphic designer is an alternate version of a digital artist. Graphic designers also use technology to create images and layouts. A graphic designer doesn’t necessarily require a bachelor’s degree, but it requires a degree in another major. The median salary for graphic designers is $46,900 in 2015. I didn’t expect anything much from the payment for graphic designers because it isn’t the most popular job to get and make a living off of it.
<br>
A web developer is also an alternative version of a digital artist. An associate’s degree is required to get a position in web developing. A decent knowledge of graphic designing and computer programming languages is also required. Web developers oversees the content of a webpage and the performance attributes. The median salary for a web developer is $64,970, about a thousand more dollars than being a digital artist, even if it’s an alternative.
<br>
All of three of those careers requires a decent understanding of digital art and graphic designing. Computer science might definitely be helpful in these careers. An understanding of computers and the principles of computing might help with developing using technology. The careers don’t give the best payment because it’s not the most demanding job in the world. However, the salary is definitely good because graphic designing and developing art with technology, in my opinion, is a good hobby and very benefiting in your own time. It’s fun because it uses your imagination and creativity to give life to the drawing even if you need a decent understanding of how to draw digitally.
