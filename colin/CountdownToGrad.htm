            My countdown to graduation is pretty short. There is only a few weeks left and there isn't much to do, other than a few tests coming up, projects, and some homework. I was hoping to go to Washington High School, but was accepted in Galileo High School. I went for an appeal and now I'm just waiting for where I'm going. I regret not applying for Lowell because they lowered their standards and I probably would've made it in if I only knew that their standards were lowered.
           <br>
            I still don't understand why I wasn't accepted into Washington. I thought it was maybe the siblings part because my sister is in Galileo on her 3rd year, so the district might've assumed I wanted to go there, even though I put Washington as my first choice. I don't think the requirements for Washington is that difficult, considering some of my friends have been accepted to it, but I was one of the only ones who had made it to Galileo, recieving their second choice. 
                <br>
                I didn't really want to go to Galileo because I didn't have anyone I know there and I didn't want to go to a high school where my sister is in. All I have to do until graduation is to wait until I get the letter, do all the work I need to do, and just consider what I'm doing over the vacation. I don't have too many plans for myself so I don't stress myself out and I'm trying to not go insane trying to end the year off nicely. There are still some things I need to do before the school year ends.
